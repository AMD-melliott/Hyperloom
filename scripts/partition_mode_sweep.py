"""Sweep the AMD compute-partition modes and report which one the workload wants.

Sets each requested mode on one card in turn, runs the same fixed benchmark on
every partition that mode creates, and sums the result. The comparison it prints
is the one an operator needs before committing a multi-hour optimization
session: under which shape does this workload go fastest, and what does that
cost in per-request latency.

**The fan-out is the whole point.** A partition gets a fraction of the card, so
a benchmark that loads one partition and ignores the rest measures a fraction of
the card. Measured on this node, one MI355X in ``CPX`` presents eight 32-CU
partitions -- a single-partition run reports roughly an eighth of the card's
throughput, making ``CPX`` look catastrophic when in aggregate it may well win.
Every figure here is therefore the sum over a mode's partitions with all of them
loaded at once, and a mode whose partitions cannot all be loaded is reported as
unmeasured rather than as slow.

**Why the privileged set lives here and not in the optimizer.** Changing the
mode is a card-wide privileged operation that evicts every process holding a GPU
context. That is reasonable between benchmarks in an operator-run script and
unreasonable inside an optimization loop that also runs agent-authored code, so
``hyperloom`` itself only ever *reads* the mode -- see
``hyperloom.common.gpu_partition`` -- and refuses at launch any session whose
streams will not fit one partition. This script is the other half of that
split: the boundary that establishes the shape the optimizer then treats as
fixed for the whole session.

**Device indices are not portable between tools, so partitions are matched on CU
count.** Measured on an 8-card MI355X node with card 0 in ``CPX``: ``amd-smi``
orders by PCI address and calls the eight partitions devices 0-7, while HSA/HIP
enumerates whole cards first and calls them devices 7-14. A device list computed
with one tool and handed to the other is wrong, and wrong invisibly -- the
benchmark runs to completion, on the wrong silicon. Partitions are selected here
the way :func:`~hyperloom.common.gpu_partition.partition_device_predicate`
documents: by matching the expected CU count, in the HIP index space the
benchmark itself will use, and narrowed to the card being swept so that an
identical CU count on a neighbouring card cannot be mistaken for a partition.

Only the target card is repartitioned; the rest of the node is left alone. That
keeps total silicon constant across the sweep, which is what makes the modes
comparable to each other.

Usage::

    # print the plan, touch nothing
    python3 scripts/partition_mode_sweep.py --benchmark-config bench.yaml --dry-run

    # sweep the modes the card reports it supports
    python3 scripts/partition_mode_sweep.py \\
        --benchmark-config /path/to/benchmark.yaml \\
        --modes SPX,DPX,QPX,CPX \\
        --output-dir /shared/partition-sweep

    # arbitrary workload; {device} and {output_dir} are substituted per partition
    python3 scripts/partition_mode_sweep.py \\
        --benchmark-command 'my_bench --gpu {device} --out {output_dir}' \\
        --per-stream-gib 20.7

Exit codes:

    0  the sweep completed and a winner was reported
    1  the sweep ran but no mode produced a valid measurement
    2  the request was refused before anything was changed
    3  the sweep finished but the card could not be restored to its entry mode
    4  the sweep stopped on an error it does not model, after reporting whatever
       it had already measured and restoring the card

Every path out of a started sweep goes through the restore and the report,
including an unexpected exception, so ``3`` stays reachable and the modes
measured before a failure are never lost to it.
