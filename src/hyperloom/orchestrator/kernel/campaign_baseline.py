"""Give the rewrite campaign a base commit that is what the server is running.

Hyperloom dirties the framework trees by design: the TraceLens and ck-blockscale
instrumentation is patched in place, fusion writes its module beside the model it
edits, and every lane's KEEP sits uncommitted until the session ends. So by the
time the controller starts, "the code being served" and "the code at HEAD" are
different things, and a campaign has to choose which one it means.

It means the former. A rewrite is measured against the running server, and the
patch it produces has to apply to the tree that server was built from. Sealing
those changes into a commit makes that tree nameable: the campaign's base commit,
the diff's starting point, and the state a borrowed repository is handed back at
all become the same object id.

Only tracked changes are sealed. Untracked files -- tuned GEMM tables, JIT
caches, an operator's own notes -- are not part of any patch and have no business
in a commit this session created.

Because it commits, sealing is also where a campaign a previous session never
handed back has to be returned. Nothing else can: both reclaims run after the
campaign, in the process that died holding it.
