The array is the intra-round execution order of the final apply round, which by
construction replays everything accumulated before it: every applied setup
command, then the base artifacts a linked build produced, then the accumulated
patches. Position carries the whole ordering contract -- there is no nesting, no
grouping key and no round index in an element.
