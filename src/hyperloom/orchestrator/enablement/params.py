        After a round that bought no ground (``attempt > 0``) the ranked

        Enumerates candidate PRs across every repo in ``plan.repos`` (framework

        ranks each :class:`hyperloom.agents.framework.models.Candidate` with

        Network + git. Enumeration is guarded per repo, so a repo that fails is
        skipped and the rest are still ranked; a run that collects nothing
        returns an empty tuple and the mandate falls back to repos-only.

        between repos and ranks whatever was collected.
