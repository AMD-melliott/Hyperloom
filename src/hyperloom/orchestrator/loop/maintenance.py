    Shared by periodic maintenance and cycle soft-restart. Resource ownership
    is resolved by the reconciler: owners it proved dead, and lanes whose holder
    both ended and proved nothing is still using them -- never inferred from
    elapsed lease budgets.

    ``leases_unverifiable`` rides the same summary because it is the other half
    of that answer: lanes still held by a holder that ended without confirming
    its cleanup. Nothing decides those -- no identity available to this process
    survives a served process that setsid's away from it -- so they are retained
    on purpose. A number that stays put while the queue does not drain is where
    an operator starts; the remedy for each one is logged once by the diagnostic.
