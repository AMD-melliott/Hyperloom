              :meth:`writeback._pitfall_severity_for` correctly excludes it

              (:meth:`explore._extract_gaps_from_attempts`), which is enough
              to group repeat denials without a dedicated bucket.
            * ``"crash"`` / ``"oom"`` / ``"hang"`` / ``"detokenizer_stall"``:
              exact-matched by :meth:`writeback._pitfall_severity_for` to
              classify a failure as crash-severity for the KB.

              ``policy_{rule}``, so this exit does not collapse into
              ``"unknown_error"`` either.
            * The raised exception's ``__class__.__name__`` (e.g.
              ``"TimeoutError"``): an executor raised instead of returning a
              result. Same reasoning — a real class beats the generic
              bucket, even though the exact name isn't enumerable up front.
            * Anything else (including empty): executors set their own
              ``error_class`` inside ``result``, or leave it unset, in which
