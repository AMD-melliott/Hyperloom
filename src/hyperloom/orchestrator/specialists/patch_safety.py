"""Universal patch-safety contract for specialist worker output.

This is the canonical home for the anti-hallucination guards that apply to
*every* specialist patch, regardless of scope (single domain / cross-domain /
freeform). It provides:

* unified-diff structural validation (a patch must carry at least one hunk),
* git-grounding (``git apply --check`` against a clean checkout so a fabricated
  patch that does not apply to real source is flagged),
* quantitative-claim guards (forbidden numeric fields, stripped rather than
  merely reported, + numeric-claim regex on the qualitative argument),
* the cross-domain Critic rule descriptors, surfaced when ``scope == 'domains'``.

Pure / dependency-light: imports only stdlib, git via subprocess, and the
stdlib-only ``hyperloom.common.unified_diff`` so it can be imported from the
runner, the Critic backend, and tests without cycles.
