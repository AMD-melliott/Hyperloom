        2026-09-21: six lanes were held that way for two hours, starving 19
        queued tasks, by holders that had already ended and whose processes had
        gone with them. The same thing would happen under this code, and is
        meant to: nothing here decides that a lane is free. What changed is that
        it announces itself within a tick, naming the lane and the statement
        that clears it, instead of taking an hour of py-spy and sqlite to find.

        A holder that ended with its cleanup unconfirmed keeps its lane, and
        nothing here takes it back. Seven rounds of review each proposed a
        cheaper proof that the lane was free -- the holder is terminal, its
        recorded process group is empty, no pidfile names a live server -- and
        each was shown by probe to be a proxy a real process can slip out of. A
        served process is setsid'd by design, its pidfile appears only after it
        answers, and a cmdline is a guess. Releasing a lane wrongly puts two
        rounds on the same cards, which corrupts quietly; holding one wrongly
        stalls a queue until an operator spends 90 seconds. The asymmetry
        decides it.

        So this pass reclaims only what liveness alone settles
        (:meth:`reap_dead_holders`), and everything else is counted and handed
        to an operator by :meth:`diagnose_unverifiable_holders`, once per
        ``(lane, holder)``, with the statement that releases it. Closing that
        gap for real needs an identity a descendant cannot escape -- a
        per-execution cgroup -- which is its own project.
