"""Per-round GPU telemetry, normalised out of the round's own benchmark report.

The numbers are already collected -- Magpie's ``GPUMonitor`` on a single node, the pod-side ``rocm-smi`` sampler on
several -- and land in ``benchmark_report.json`` under ``gpu_monitor``. What was missing is a reading of them that a
consumer can trust, per round, without knowing which producer wrote the block.

Two things make that non-trivial, and both have burned this data before:

* **The producers disagree on names and on shape.** Magpie writes ``power_watts`` as a pre-aggregated
  ``{min, max, avg}`` block; the multi-node harvester writes ``power_w`` as a flat scalar per sample. Reading only the
  short spelling is what left every single-node session's GPU numbers reading 0.0 -- not absent, *zero*, which is a
  plausible-looking lie.
* **Absent and zero are different findings.** A card that drew no power and a card nobody sampled must not produce the
  same number. Every metric here is ``float | None`` and is never coerced.

Written per round rather than aggregated per session on purpose: a session mixes baseline, explore and roofline rounds
whose power and thermal behaviour have nothing to do with each other, and averaging them describes no round that
actually ran.
