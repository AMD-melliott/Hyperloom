    Two numbers, because they answer two questions and one clock cannot answer
    both. ``boot_sec`` is how long the round took to come up, measured from spawn
    to this moment on one ``time.monotonic()`` reading in the process that
    spawned the child. The wall-clock instant beside it only ever says *which
    round* the stamp belongs to.

    Keeping the boot a duration is what makes it safe to read across a process
    boundary. On the Ray path the round runs inside an actor, possibly on another
    host; subtracting the actor's wall-clock from the driver's would charge the
    boot for whatever the two clocks disagree by, and a positive disagreement
    inflates the boot and makes the budget gates refuse rounds that fit. A
    duration crosses the boundary meaning the same thing on both sides -- the
    same reason ``session_remaining_sec`` is passed to the actor as a duration
    rather than as a deadline.

    A file is used because it crosses that boundary without widening the round's
    return value, and the round's output directory is already how post-mortem
    evidence gets back (the caller reads the same directory's ``server.log`` to
    classify server deaths).

    Best effort: a round whose stamp cannot be written loses a measurement, which
    callers already have to handle, and must not lose the round.

    Args:
        server_log_path: The ``<output_dir>/server.log`` path from the caller.
        boot_sec: Seconds from spawn to this moment, on the spawning process's
            monotonic clock. Required rather than defaulted: a caller that
            omitted it would write a well-formed stamp claiming the round booted
            instantly, which reads as a whole round of benchmark and is the one
            wrong answer the two-field format exists to make impossible.
