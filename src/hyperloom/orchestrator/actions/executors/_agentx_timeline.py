"""The AgentX workload timeline, read from aiperf's own per-request export.

KV occupancy is engine-wide: it says the pool filled, never which work filled it. Answering "what was running when it
filled" needs the workload's own timeline, and aiperf already writes one. ``profile_export.jsonl`` carries one record
per request with epoch-nanosecond stamps and the identifiers that reconstruct the hierarchy above it -- session,
conversation, turn index, request id -- at the default ``--export-level records``. Nothing has to be asked of aiperf
and no flag has to be added; the file was simply never read.

This module turns those records into two things:

* an event stream (``phase`` / ``trajectory`` / ``turn`` / ``request`` start and end, plus ``first_token``), written
  beside the KV artifact so a consumer can join the two on time;
* an exact in-flight count per KV scrape window, folded into the KV rows themselves, so the common question -- which
  trajectories were live when the pool spiked -- is answerable without the join.

The same rule as everywhere else in this collection path: nothing here may raise, and nothing missing becomes zero. A
round without the export is a round whose KV metrics are still worth having.
