      lists and is declared ``delete``, so the replay removes a file the

    The strip level is PROVEN, not guessed. ``git apply -R --check -pN``
    succeeds only when the tree already holds this patch's postimage at N, so

    Earlier this was inferred from whether each named path happened to exist,

    Absence carries no level information, so a patch whose every entry is a

    This is the only question worth asking of a replay contract: does
    ``base_sha`` plus these patches, in this order, produce the entries the
    capture is about to ship? Everything cheaper answers a different question
    and gets it wrong in both directions.

    Reading the diff headers says what a patch DECLARES and nothing about the
    tree. Reverse-applying each patch against the FINAL tree is worse than it
    looks: git locates a postimage with an offset, so a patch that was never
    applied reverses against a similar block elsewhere in the file; a deletion
    reverses by creating a file, whatever it writes and at whatever level; a
    mode disagreement is only a warning; and it is simultaneously too strict,
    because an earlier round's patch cannot reverse once a later round has
    rewritten the same region, and a patch editing a file an earlier round
    created has no preimage in the base at all.

    Replaying forward has none of those problems: every patch meets exactly the
    tree it was authored against, the inventory comes from git rather than from
    a text parse, and the final comparison covers existence, kind, bytes and
    the executable bit for every entry the stack touched.

    Args:
        framework_root: The captured tree, compared against the replay.
        patches: The accepted stack's patches for this root, in apply order.
