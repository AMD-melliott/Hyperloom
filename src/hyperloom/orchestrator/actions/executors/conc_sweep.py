"""ActionRunner for the ``conc_sweep`` SWEEP-phase action.

Thin shell around ``orchestrator.kernel.conc_sweep.run_conc_sweep``. The
Coordinator auto-enqueues one ``conc_sweep`` task per SWEEP phase via
``_enqueue_internal_conc_sweep_task`` (when ``conc_sweep_enabled``: on by
default, off under AgentX; force either way with ``--enable-conc-sweep`` /
``--no-enable-conc-sweep``); a LLM-proposed
``conc_sweep`` delegate is denied by PolicyGate.

Inputs (``task.params``): ``concs`` (CONC ladder),
``total_budget_sec`` (``None`` disables the gate; ``<=0`` means no time is left
and the sweep skips without booting a server).

Reloads ``SharedState`` from ``ctx.extra['session_dir']`` to pick up the
live current_best / baseline_tput / isl / osl / baseline_config_path,
which would be stale if pinned at enqueue time.

Also opens the sweep's SBD V6 timeline event. The event is opened here rather
than inside ``run_conc_sweep`` because the event id is a property of the
dispatch -- the phase and macro cycle the sweep was enqueued in -- and because
the sweep's own entry point is called directly by tests and scripts that have
no session bound and want no event.
