"""KV-cache observability sampled from the engine's ``/metrics`` endpoint.

The engine is the only thing that knows how full its KV pool is, and until now nothing read it: a run could spend its
whole budget retracting requests and the breakdown would show only "throughput low". This module is the reader.

``/metrics`` is the primary source rather than ``server.log`` because it wins on every axis that matters here -- full
float precision instead of the log's two decimals, stable metric names instead of names that branch on the model's pool
type, explicit units, and ``kv_evictable_tokens``, which the log cannot express at all and which is the only way to
separate the two occupancy readings this module reports (see :class:`KvSample`).

There are two collectors, and the artifact says which one produced its rows in ``sample_source``. On an AgentX round
aiperf is already scraping the same endpoint for its own purposes, so its export is adopted wholesale: it samples on a
tighter cadence, takes a reading at each phase boundary of its own accord, and stamps every record with the phase from
the process that owns the transition -- which removes the boundary lag rather than correcting for it. Everything else
-- synthetic benchmarks, the accuracy eval, boot, and any round killed before aiperf flushed -- has no such export, and
is covered by scraping from the watchdog loop below.

Phase attribution has two sources, and the artifact always says which one it used. Preferred is aiperf's progress API,
whose ``phases.<name>.start_ns`` is stamped when the phase actually begins; the fallback is the ``aiperf.log`` line the
watchdog greps for, which is written after the transition and read on the next poll. Both lags land on the boundary, so
under the fallback the samples either side of it are systematically credited to the phase that just ended. When the
authoritative stamps are available the rows are re-labelled and the counter windows re-bracketed from them at close --
which is why every row carries its raw per-series counters, and not just a phase-level first/last pair.

Below the phase, the workload timeline comes from aiperf's per-request export; see :mod:`._agentx_timeline`. That gives
each row the trajectories, turns and requests in flight during its scrape window, and writes the event stream beside
this artifact.

What this does not do is stop the workload at a boundary. An exact counter total needs the client to quiesce, take one
snapshot, and resume, and aiperf exposes no such control: the boundary here is exact to aiperf's own stamp, and the
counter attribution to the scrape interval either side of it.

Two rules run through everything below:

* **Never raise.** This samples a benchmark that is being measured; a scrape failure must cost the run nothing. Every
  entry point returns a value.
* **Never coerce a missing reading to zero.** A pool nobody sampled and a pool that is genuinely empty are different
  findings, and collapsing them is how an optimizer ends up steering on a number that was never measured. Absent means
  ``None``, all the way out to the breakdown.
