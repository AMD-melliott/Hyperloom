"""The one reasoning-effort vocabulary Hyperloom and KernelForge both speak.

Five names, because five is what the deeper surface can express. The Claude
CLI's ``--effort`` takes ``low | medium | high | xhigh | max``; the
OpenAI-compatible gateway's ``reasoning_effort`` takes
``none | minimal | low | medium | high | xhigh`` and returns 400 on ``max``.
``low``..``xhigh`` are common to both and are levels as written. ``max`` is a
real Claude level, so it is one here too, and :func:`gateway_reasoning_effort`
projects it onto ``xhigh`` -- the gateway's deepest -- for anything speaking
the OpenAI protocol. ``minimal`` and ``none`` go the other way: the gateway
takes them but the Claude CLI does not know them, and there is no Claude level
below ``low`` to project them onto, so they are not levels at all.

Every component reads this one table. Two tables can disagree -- a
``HYPERLOOM_REASONING_EFFORT=minimal`` that Hyperloom's own calls accept and
the Forge Codex backend rejects. The projection lives here for the same
reason: folded inside the Codex backend only, ``max`` would reach Hyperloom's
own chat.completions unprojected and come back a 400.

The ordering is meaningful: an index is the level's rank, so a call site that
caps a session can compare what it allows against what the deployment asked
for. Nothing here talks to a provider -- this module is a name list, so both
components can import it without importing a transport.
