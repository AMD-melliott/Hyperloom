"""Coverage for the grading axis the SBD V6 document declares and the axes it publishes.

An AgentX replay is ranked on the slow-tail interactivity percentile with throughput held as a guard; a
synthetic run is ranked on output throughput alone. On the canonical corpus the two axes differ by roughly
two orders of magnitude, and every throughput field in the breakdown is the output axis by construction, so
without the declaration a consumer would sort one kind of session against the other and every number would
look plausible.

Two separate facts, deliberately not resolved from one another. ``metadata.grading`` is the axis the session
was configured for; ``outcome.validation.graded_on`` is the axis the run actually decided its last promotion
on, which differs whenever a comparison could not supply the axis pair.
