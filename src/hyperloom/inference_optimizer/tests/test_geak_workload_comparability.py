"""Regression tests for the workload-comparability guard on the GEAK candidate.

``KernelPhase._record_geak_candidate`` computes ``self_reported_gain_pct`` from
two numbers measured by DIFFERENT harnesses: ``final_throughput_tok_s`` is
GEAK's, ``shared_state.baseline_tput`` is ours. That percentage is meaningful
only when both harnesses measured the same workload.

In AgentX mode they do not. Our baseline replays real agentic traces (p50 ~89k
input tokens) while the handoff still carries the CLI's synthetic isl/osl
defaults of 1024/1024, so a GEAK run that believes those defaults measures a
~1k-token synthetic sweep. Measured on Kimi-K3: GEAK's 465.676 tok/s against our
168.998 tok/s agentic baseline computes to roughly +175% with no kernel changed.

The rebench downstream would eventually reject such a candidate, but the number
is written into ``geak_pending`` the moment the candidate is recorded, and
anything reading that record before the rebench lands would read a real-looking
gain. So the gain is refused at the point of computation instead.

GEAK states the verdict in ``baseline_basis.workload_comparability.comparable``.
The guard is deliberately asymmetric: only an explicit ``False`` suppresses.
An absent verdict is an older GEAK that only ever ran the synthetic path, and
must keep behaving exactly as before -- that is what makes this safe to ship
without touching the established fixed-ISL/OSL flow.
