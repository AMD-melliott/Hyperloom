"""The SBD V6 ``conc_sweep`` event: the concurrency curve, recorded live.

The sweep runs the CONC ladder twice -- once on the session's optimized server
args, once on none -- and pairs the two curves into a speedup per concurrency.
``reports/conc_sweep_summary.json`` is a result document, so a ladder that
measured three rungs of eight looks the same whether the budget gate refused
the rest, the server would not boot at those concurrencies, or the session
started closing. The rows here are therefore the sweep's own decisions,
recorded where they are made; the measurement itself is the same flattening
the report writes.

The event is flat rather than an array of actions: the SWEEP phase enqueues
through ``create_or_return_existing``, so one phase and macro cycle hold at
most one sweep. Rows are still keyed by the dispatched task id, so a second
sweep cannot merge into the first; assembly publishes the newest and counts
the rest.
