"""The SBD V6 ``warm_start`` event: the T0 Recipe KB lookup, recorded live.

At session start T0 asks the KB whether anyone has already optimized this
workload, and either anchors on what it finds or starts cold.

Whether the lookup ran and what it found are two facts and two fields:
``status`` is the lookup's own outcome, ``match_status`` is what it found. The
split is load-bearing, because on a cold KB T0 stamps its own anchor row before
searching, then matches that row and demotes it to ``seed_only`` -- a status
that graded the finding would report every first-ever session as degraded.

Reads are recorded one row each, and only inside T0's own lookup window: the
recipe audit log also carries KB writes and the mid-session reads from
``_kb_amend_recipe``, and neither belongs to the anchor's tally.
