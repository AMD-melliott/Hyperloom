"""Author-time recording of the SBD v6 ``metadata`` section.

Every metadata fact is written the moment it is decided instead of being
re-derived when the breakdown is exported: session identity and the container
image when the manifest is stamped, the structural model summary when the
model's own config is parsed, the launch configuration and session lifecycle
on every state save, and the Langfuse entrypoint when the emitter settles.

All writes go through the recorder's ``metadata`` singleton and are
deep-merged, so each producer contributes only the keys it owns and a later
partial update never erases an earlier one. Recording is best-effort: a
failure here degrades the exported section to its collector fallback and never
propagates to the caller.
