"""The SBD V6 ``stack`` event: what was adopted, and what each adoption bought.

Everything else on the timeline is an attempt; this is the ordered list of
attempts that survived, with the throughput each one moved.

Two invariants carry the ledger. The throughput an adoption beat is recorded at
the moment the lift accepts it, because it is in scope there and nowhere
afterwards. And every contribution is measured against the *session baseline*,
the one denominator they all share: on it the contributions add up exactly, so
``unattributed_gain_pct`` means throughput that appeared between one adoption's
measurement and the next's, which no adoption claims.

The event spans the whole session because the stack does: adoptions arrive from
four phases into one ordered ledger, and scoping it by phase would cut the
chain at every boundary.
