"""The SBD V6 ``kernel`` event: one row per fact, assembled at the close.

A KERNEL entry produces facts over minutes to hours -- lane runs, rebench
verdicts, GEAK's whole delegated campaign -- and the reason they are written as
one fragment per row rather than accumulated in memory is not write volume. It
is that the row is the unit that gets updated: a lane run is recorded when it
starts and again when its rebench settles, and a fragment keyed by that run
merges the two without anyone reading the first write back. Held in memory, the
same two-stage arrival needs a mutable object that only the writing process
has, so a resumed process either loses the first half or re-derives it.

Recording and assembly are therefore separate halves of this module, and only
assembly ever sees a whole event. :class:`KernelEventRecorder` writes rows and
knows nothing about arrays; :func:`assemble_kernel_ext` reads the rows back and
decides every wire position, ordering and count. The split is what lets
finalize rebuild the event of a session that was killed mid-phase from exactly
the same rows, through exactly the same code, rather than through a second
projection that agrees with this one only until one of them is edited.

The wire shape assembly produces has three layers, and which layer a fact
belongs in is decided by what kind of fact it is rather than by who wrote it.
``attempts`` holds every candidate either route produced, normalized to one
shape. ``rebench``, ``integrate`` and ``measurements`` hold the evidence that
ruled on them. ``forge`` and ``geak`` hold only what is peculiar to one route
-- forge's trace analysis and re-profile, GEAK's handoff, delegation and
product -- and ``outcome`` states how the whole visit ran, in one vocabulary
both routes reach.

Settlement stays in assembly because it is a join: an attempt is kept because
an instrument measured it, and neither row exists when the other is written.
The instruments differ by route -- a GEAK candidate is re-benched end to end, a
forge candidate timed by the lane that produced it -- so each settled attempt
records which one ruled on it. The event's verdict and status are read off
those settled attempts, at the close, once every row is on disk.

One instrument is deliberately not waited for. The integrate gate runs after
the visit exits and records into the event of the cycle it settles in, so its
verdict on a forge patch may never reach the event that produced the patch.
The visit therefore concludes on what it can measure itself, and a reader
tracking a patch end to end follows ``delivered`` into the ``integrate`` rows
of a later event rather than expecting this one to be amended.

Every ``*_at`` argument in this module is an ISO timestamp.

    is not the visit's to state, and it does not exist yet when the visit
    closes -- which is why this is a module function taking a cycle rather
    than a method on the visit's recorder. A closed event still accepts row
    fragments; nothing is assembled until the export reads the whole spool.

    The row is attached to the event of the cycle the gate settled in, which
    is the cycle that ran the gate rather than necessarily the one that
    produced the patch: a patch whose integration faulted is retried on its
    own budget and can settle a cycle or more later. ``kernel_id`` is on the
    row so the two can be joined either way, and the row is only written when
    that event exists, so a verdict never mints an event of its own.

    Args:
        decision: The gate's verdict (``KEEP`` / ``REVERT``).
        fault_count: How many attempts never measured the patch fairly.
        rejected_reason: Why the patch was rejected outright, when it was -- an
            exhausted budget rather than a verdict on the code.
        basis: Throughput basis the gain was measured on (``hot`` / ``cold``);
            a gain is meaningless without the baseline behind it.
        gain_attributed: Whether the measured gain is this one kernel's. A
            rebench carrying several kernels measured all of them together, so
            the gain is real but unattributable.
