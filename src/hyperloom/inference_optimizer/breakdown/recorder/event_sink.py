"""Where an executor's rows land, decided by its caller rather than by itself.

This is the write side's boundary: a row that cannot be written is dropped with
a warning rather than taken out on the phase that produced it. What counts as
"cannot be written" is :data:`~.recorder_warnings.RECORDING_ERRORS` -- the
spool failing, or no session being bound. A recorder that raises anything else
is broken, and is left to say so.
