#: Statuses that mean an event is still open: the one :func:`open_event` writes,
#: and the absence of an event behind the fragments. Every other status is one a
#: closing write put there, so finalize leaves it alone. Stated this way round
#: because the terminal vocabulary is each event type's own -- a warm replay
#: closes ``rejected`` -- and an allowlist here would silently recover a status
#: it had not been told about, overwriting a real verdict with ``interrupted``.
OPEN_EVENT_STATUSES: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"", EVENT_STATUS_RUNNING})

#: An event on disk as ``running`` whose closing write never ran. Its sequence
#: is on the event-level fragment, so finalize updates that same entry.
