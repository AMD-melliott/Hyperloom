"""Read-side of the breakdown recorder.

Assembles the per-producer fragments written by :class:`~.recorder.Recorder`
into a ``{section: value}`` mapping for the ``session_breakdown.json``
envelope: a ``singleton`` section takes the payload of the latest fragment by
``ts``, a plain ``item`` section concatenates its payloads by ``seq`` then
``ts``. A compose pass runs last and reconciles across fragments. Bad or
partial fragments are skipped and noted in ``warnings``.
