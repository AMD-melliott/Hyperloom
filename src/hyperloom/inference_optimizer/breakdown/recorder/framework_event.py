"""The SBD V6 ``framework_agent`` event: both OPTIMIZE arms, recorded live.

FRAMEWORK_AGENT runs two arms in one phase: the configuration arm searches
server args and env vars, the source arm lands upstream patches. The phase
leaves only when both have run dry, because one arm going quiet is a reason to
switch levers inside the phase rather than to abandon the other.

The wire shape follows the progression a proposal moves along rather than the
arm it belongs to, since the arms differ in content and not in lifecycle:
``proposals`` is the main line, ``runs`` holds the dispatch facts those rows
reference, and ``attempts`` is one uniform row per thing measured, which the
adoption ledger walks. ``plateau`` is off that progression, and each evaluation
records the inputs and thresholds it used because re-deriving them later reads
a history that has kept growing. A proposal names its producer because the
orchestration agent, the seed grid and the switch manifest all yield variants
nobody proposed.

Gates and lifecycle steps are their own sections, composed into the rows that
own them at assembly: a row's list field cannot accumulate, because repeated
writes on one key deep-merge and a merge replaces a list wholesale.
