"""Author-time recording of the SBD v6 ``critic`` section.

The critic agent reviews the session as a whole, iteration after iteration,
and each iteration is complete the moment the review comes back: what it spoke
about, how its rulings fell, and the four artifacts it left behind. This
records it there. It is the session-level channel and does not compete with the
per-proposal verdicts, which stay with the proposals they judge.

An iteration has no single verdict -- it rules on every proposal in front of it
-- so the row carries the distribution of its rulings rather than one string,
and its prose comes off the ``send_message`` intent in the emitted envelope,
which is where the agent actually speaks.

Iterations are keyed by a content-derived id rather than the process-local
iteration number, because that number is reused when a session resumes and
workdirs are pruned underneath it -- keying on it would let a later iteration
overwrite an earlier one's history.

Recording is best-effort: a failure here degrades the exported section and must
never propagate into the review loop it is describing.
