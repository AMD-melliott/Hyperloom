"""Where a recording that failed says so.

Recording is best-effort by design: the run outranks its own record, so a
writer that raises is caught and the run carries on. What that left behind was
a breakdown quietly missing facts -- the export looked complete, and the only
trace of the loss was a ``DEBUG`` line in a log nobody keeps.

This routes those losses into the write-warning sidecar the V6 timeline
writers already park their failures in, so a lost fragment reaches
``metadata.warnings`` by the same path a lost timeline event does, and there
is one place to look rather than two.

Two rules hold the rest together. Noting a failure must never raise, because
it runs inside the handler for one. And it must never recurse: the note is
itself a write, so if it fails there is nothing left to do but log.

#: What recording can fail with that is not a defect in the recorder itself.

#: The spool is one JSON file per row, so a write or a read-back fails the way
#: the filesystem does; the only other way in is with no session bound, which a
#: subprocess hits by design. ``ValueError`` covers a malformed event id, the
#: one piece of caller input the sink validates.
#:
#: Everything else -- a ``TypeError`` projecting a row, an ``AttributeError``
#: on a result that changed shape -- is a bug in the recorder. Catching those
#: too is what let a breakdown go quietly wrong while every phase reported
#: success, so they are left to raise where they can be seen and fixed.
