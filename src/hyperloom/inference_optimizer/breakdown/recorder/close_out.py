"""Author-time recording of the SBD v6 ``close`` section.

The CLOSE sequencer states what it did as it does it. The verdict cannot be
derived at export time, because ``session_breakdown`` is itself a step in the
middle of the sequence, so the sequencer's own last act is the only thing that
knows the sequence finished. Until it writes, the section stands at
``running``, leaving three states distinguishable on the wire: no ``close``
fragment (the close-out was never reached), ``running`` (the mid-sequence
snapshot, or a process that died), and any other status (the verdict).

Recording is best-effort: spool failures are parked by :class:`Recorder`
and must not propagate into the wind-down they describe.
