"""The SBD V6 ``warm_replay`` event: replaying a KB recipe, recorded live.

A warm replay takes a recipe another session validated, measures it here, and
either promotes it onto ``current_best`` or rolls it back. The arc is a chain
of gates -- throughput validity, image quality, accuracy, the keep threshold,
replayable params, and the checkout promotion -- any one of which can end it.
Each gate writes its own row as it is evaluated, so a gate that never ran is
absent rather than false.

The measurement's anchor is the baseline captured at enqueue time, recorded at
the moment it is used because the phase holds it in a local and drops it. It is
deliberately *not* the number the adoption row chains from, which is the
recorded session baseline; recording both is what lets a reader see when they
diverged, the re-baseline case. The event cites the baseline action that
produced its numbers rather than restating them, keyed by the same task id.
