"""The SBD V6 ``enablement`` event: the repair lane, recorded as it runs.

A combo that cannot boot -- or boots and fails its accuracy eval -- opens a
lane that dispatches an authoring specialist, applies its patch, optionally
compiles a component, benches the result, and either lands or rearms against
the next gap. Each round is one row, keyed by the specialist task that authored
it, so the sequence stays legible: counters cannot say which round landed the
fix, and the lane's own ``launch_log`` is replaced on every advance.

The event covers the whole session rather than a phase, because the lane does:
a combo that cannot boot never leaves PRELUDE, and the round repairing it is
judged in FRAMEWORK_AGENT. Nothing here holds a recorder object for the same
reason -- the facts are produced in six modules on different ticks, so every
entry point below is a module-level function that opens the event idempotently
and records its own row.
