"""Session close-out for SBD V6.

``close`` is a top-level V6 key rather than a timeline event: it describes how
the session was wrapped up, not a stage that competes for wall-clock with the
others. That fixed position is the point — a timeline event vanishes when it
does not happen, whereas a session that never closed cleanly is exactly the
case this key has to be able to state.

The CLOSE sequencer records the close-out as it performs it (see
:mod:`..recorder.close_out`), and this collector's job is to put that recording
on the wire. One thing is still done here
rather than at author time: the step vocabulary is checked so a producer that
starts emitting a new step name surfaces as a warning instead of passing
unnoticed.

Historical per-turn agent fragments are exported as the top-level
``robustness`` key; the close block preserves historical close-out findings
without fetching new findings.

**The section is written twice, and the first pass is deliberately partial.**
``session_breakdown`` is itself a step in the middle of the sequence, so when
the breakdown is written the steps after it have not run yet. The recording
reports ``running`` at that point — it is the sequencer's own last act that
records a verdict — and the sequencer then calls
:func:`~..exporter.patch_breakdown_close` to splice the settled section back
in. A ``running`` breakdown may be an in-progress snapshot; it does not by
itself show that close-out terminated before settling.

A reader wanting to know whether a step genuinely failed must look at
``steps[].status``; the absence of a step is not evidence against it.
``langfuse_flush`` records ``done`` when the sequencer step returns and
``failed`` if it raises; ``done`` alone does not attest to live delivery.

The projection below is the fallback for a session with no recorded close
fragments, and is retained only for the length of the migration.
