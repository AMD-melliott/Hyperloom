than derived: the receipt is a different process's record of what it sent.

    """Assemble the ``langfuse`` section: was the trace pushed live, and how much.

    Two-tier source (the breakdown is normally written *before* the
    session-end ``flush_session``, so the on-disk receipt may not exist yet):

    1. ``reports/trace/langfuse_receipt.json`` if present -- the post-flush
       receipt with final counts (``receipt_source="receipt_file"``).
    2. Otherwise a live read of the per-session emitter singleton -- reports
       the gating + redacted config + in-process running counts
       (``receipt_source="live_emitter"``, ``counts_final=False``).

    Either way credentials are redacted to host + presence booleans. Never
    raises: any failure degrades to a minimal ``config_only`` view so the
    breakdown still records whether the feature was even on.

    Args:
        session_dir (Path): Absolute session root.
        manifest (dict[str, Any]): Parsed ``manifest.json``.
        warnings (list[str]): Shared warnings list (mutated in place on receipt
            / emitter read failures).

    Returns:
        dict[str, Any]: The ``langfuse`` section, tagged with a
        ``receipt_source`` of ``receipt_file`` / ``live_emitter`` /
        ``config_only`` depending on which tier resolved.
