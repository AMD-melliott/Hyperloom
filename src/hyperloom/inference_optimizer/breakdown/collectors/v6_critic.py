"""The critic agent's own run, for SBD V6.

``critic`` is a top-level V6 key rather than a timeline event: the agent
reviews the session as a whole and its iterations are not a stage competing
for wall-clock with the others. The per-proposal verdicts stay with the
proposals they judge; what this key carries is the agent's own run.

The iterations are recorded when each review comes back (see
:mod:`..recorder.critic_out`), so this collector only puts them on the wire.
There is no projection behind it: an iteration's topic and verdict exist only
in the exchange that produced them, and rebuilding those from whatever
workdirs survived pruning is what the section it replaces did.
