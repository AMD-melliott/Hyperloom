#: AgentX is on but its benchmark client (aiperf) is missing or is not the
#: pinned build, and the runtime install could not supply it. An
#: environment/supply gap, not a code gap: nothing downstream can author its
#: way out of it, so the run halts on the FIRST occurrence instead of
#: spending the budget in the enablement lane.
AGENTX_PREFLIGHT_STOP_REASON: str = "agentx_client_unavailable"

#: A patch lifecycle owed the framework tree a revert and could not complete it,
#: so the tree still holds patches the session never measured against. Two
#: independent recoveries -- the integrate sentinel and the kernel stack
#: checkpoint -- halt on this, and both refuse to continue rather than measure a
#: tree whose contents they cannot account for. The stack checkpoint also halts
#: when it cannot bind itself to the ledger rows it was written from, which says
#: the same thing about a tree whose members are no longer identifiable.

#: or its tick wedged.
