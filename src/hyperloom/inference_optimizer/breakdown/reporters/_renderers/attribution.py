    The shares are taken against what the session actually moved, so a source
    that claims half the gain reads as half. That denominator is larger than
    the sum of the claims whenever the workload moved between adopted steps,
    and the difference gets its own row: dropping it would leave shares that
    silently fail to reach 100% with nothing to say why.

    Args:
        breakdown (dict[str, Any]): The full ``session_breakdown.json`` dict.
