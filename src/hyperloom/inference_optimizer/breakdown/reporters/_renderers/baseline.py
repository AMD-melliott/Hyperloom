"""Baseline measurement renderer.

Read off the ``baseline`` events on the V6 timeline, whose actions the
executor recorded as each measurement ran. The flat projection this replaces
was assembled at export time, which is why it had to reconstruct the latency
by walking ``runs/baseline/`` on disk and could pair a throughput from one
measurement with a TTFT from another.
