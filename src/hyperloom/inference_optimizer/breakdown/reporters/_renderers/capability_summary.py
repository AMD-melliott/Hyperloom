"""Capability summary renderer — status/attempts/keeps table + per-capability decisions.

Each row is built from the events the capability recorded as it ran: the two
kernel routes from the per-source tallies on the ``kernel`` events, the
configuration arm and the specialists from the ``framework_agent`` events. The
flat projection this replaces re-derived the same counts at export time by
pairing ``<action>_attempts`` rows against the optimization stack, which is
why it needed a fallback that credited a capability from the stack alone.

A capability the session never invoked still gets a row. That absence is the
section's most load-bearing output -- it is what tells a reader that an
untested area is untested rather than clean.
