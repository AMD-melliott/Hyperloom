"""Shared rollup over the ``framework_agent`` timeline events.

The capability summary and the parameter-search section both need the same
account of what the configuration arm tried and what it kept, and the summary
additionally needs it split by which producer proposed the attempt. Building
it once here is what keeps the two sections from disagreeing.

An attempt names the proposal it came from and a proposal names its producer,
so attributing a KEEP to the specialist that suggested it is a join rather
than a guess. Attempts with no proposal behind them -- the seeded grid -- are
attributed to the arm itself.

The ``_`` prefix marks this as a helper: it registers no renderer.
