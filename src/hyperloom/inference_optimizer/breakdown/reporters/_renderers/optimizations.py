"""Adopted-optimization renderer, read off the canonical stack ledger.

Every figure here is read from ``outcome.validation``, which the stack timeline
event recorded as each adoption was accepted. A fact recorded at the moment
it becomes true has no second stream to disagree with, so the only guard
counts published are about the measurements rather than about the
bookkeeping.
