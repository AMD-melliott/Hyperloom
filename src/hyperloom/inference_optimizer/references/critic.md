# Critic Backend Selection

The Critic role has two backend modes. Default is `--critic-agent` (no flag
needed).

| Flag | Backend class | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| (none) / `--critic-agent` | `CriticAgentBackend` | Drives the `hyperloom.agents.critic` skill runtime via `python -m hyperloom.agents.critic.runtime.cli prepare-review` → Codex chat completion → `python -m hyperloom.agents.critic.runtime.cli commit-review`. Adds recipe KB priors when configured, per-session memory + idempotent `reviewed_msg_ids` (no double-verdict), `judge_bundle.review_constraints` injected into the LLM prompt, and `needs_review` / `critic_unavailable` source when context is missing. |
| `--critic-mock` | `MockCriticBackend` | Always-approve adapter. Use for offline / smoke tests when Codex creds aren't available. |

Default is overridable per pod via `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_DEFAULT_CRITIC_BACKEND`
(one of `mock` / `agent`).

## Review transport: `--critic-protocol {auto,openai,anthropic}`

Both transports run the full critic-agent runtime; only the review reasoning
call differs. There is no degraded critic, so a transport whose credentials are
missing fails at startup rather than silently changing the review quality.

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | Anthropic-only config picks `anthropic`; everything else picks `openai`. |
| `openai` | `achat_completion`, i.e. `AsyncOpenAI.chat.completions`. Needs whatever `resolve_openai_client_config` accepts: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or an Anthropic gateway bearer whose base URL can be derived. A gateway key with no resolvable base URL is rejected, since it would be sent to official OpenAI. |
| `anthropic` | `aanthropic_completion`, which picks the transport: the Messages API for an API key or gateway bearer, the `claude` CLI only when `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is the sole credential. |

Force `anthropic` when both sides are configured but the Critic should run on a
Claude subscription; `auto` would otherwise choose the OpenAI transport.

## Required env when `--critic-agent` is active

| Var | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CRITIC_AGENT_ROOT` | Path to the directory containing `runtime/cli.py`. | in-tree `$REPO_ROOT/src/hyperloom/agents/critic/` |
| `CRITIC_KB_CLIENT_MODE` | Critic runtime prior-store mode. Hyperloom sets this to `inmemory` by default; use `live` only when deliberately wiring the standalone critic KB client. | `inmemory` |
| `KB_BASE_URL` | Required only when `CRITIC_KB_CLIENT_MODE=live`; unused in the default Hyperloom path. | unset |
| `KB_TIMEOUT_MS` / `KB_RETRY_MAX` / `KB_DEAD_LETTER_DIR` | Optional runtime tuning for the critic KB client and dead-letter handling. | runtime defaults |
| `CRITIC_SESSION_MEMORY_DIR` | Where the runtime persists per-session decisions / reviewed_msg_ids. | `$SESSION_DIR/critic-session-memory` (auto-set by the optimizer; co-located with the Coordinator session and cleaned up alongside it). |
| `WORKSPACE_PATH` | Skill root the critic-agent runtime resolves prompt assets against. | `$REPO_ROOT` (auto-set). |

CLI startup checks that `CRITIC_AGENT_ROOT` resolves to a real directory with
`runtime/cli.py`, then runs `python -m hyperloom.agents.critic.runtime.cli --help`
(90s timeout; override via `CRITIC_AGENT_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SEC`) before the
Coordinator boots. Missing or broken runtime aborts the
run with a clear error pointing at `--critic-mock` as the offline bypass.

## Per-turn artefacts (audit trail)

Each Critic turn writes a 6-digit workdir under
`$SESSION_DIR/critic-workdir/<turn_idx>/` (`request.json` / `judge_bundle.json`
/ `review.json` / `emit.json`) plus session memory under
`$SESSION_DIR/critic-session-memory/<session_id>/`. The backend prunes to the
latest 50 turn workdirs each tick. Inspect these when debugging critic verdicts
(see `troubleshooting.md`).
