# Launcher Operations

Use this when the main skill says to install, launch, resume, or monitor an
optimizer session. Keep `$USER_DATA_PATH` as the workspace root and learn
`SESSION_DIR` from `--launch-info-file`; never guess by timestamp.

## Setup

Credentials must already be in the shell environment: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
`OPENAI_BASE_URL`. Optional source-root overrides are local only:
`INFERENCEX_PATH`, `TRACELENS_ROOT`, `TRACELENS_INTERNAL_ROOT`.

```bash
set -e
export REPO_ROOT="$(pwd -P)"
INSTALL_SH="${REPO_ROOT}/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh"
if [ ! -f "$INSTALL_SH" ]; then
  INSTALL_SH="${REPO_ROOT}/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh"
fi
. "${INSTALL_SH%/*}/runtime_env.sh"
load_dotenv_no_clobber
export USER_DATA_PATH
bash "$INSTALL_SH"
```

`install.sh` is the only full install entrypoint. CLI preflight reads the generated
`kernel-agent.env.sh` in-process; do not source it in the launch shell or derive
auth aliases, GEAK paths, or InferenceX paths by hand. `runtime_env.sh` only fills
missing or empty shell values from workspace `.env`, without executing its contents.
In Docker mode, it excludes dotenv-provided Python/venv pins but preserves explicit
shell selections. Do not manually repair `$USER_DATA_PATH/runtime/` or
`${HYPERLOOM_CACHE_DIR:-$REPO_ROOT/.cache}/`.

Optionally write `<session_dir>/model_arch.json` if the architecture is known.
It is advisory only; skip rather than guessing. Do not write the file at the
`$USER_DATA_PATH` workspace root because concurrent sessions share that path.

## Launch Flags

```bash
python3 -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize \
  --model "$MODEL_PATH" \
  --framework vllm \
  --gpu-type MI300X \
  --model-class moe_mla \
  --max-hours 2 \
  --compare-against-gpu B200
```

- `--model`: required model path.
- `--framework`: `sglang` (default), `vllm`, or `atom`; atom is single-node only.
- `--gpu-type`: optional; omitted means rocm-smi auto-detect.
- `--model-class`: optional; when unset, Coordinator boot infers it from
  model metadata or model-path family keywords. Examples: `dense`, `moe_mla`,
  `moe_swa`, `moe_mla_nsa`.
- `--compare-against-gpu`: optional external reference GPU.
- `--quantize`: only when requested; read `quantization.md` first.

## Smoke Test And Preflight

After IR-2, smoke-test the CLI in the same shell:

```bash
export HYPERLOOM_KERNEL_AGENT_ROOT="$REPO_ROOT/src/hyperloom/agents/kernel"
export KERNEL_AGENT_ROOT="$HYPERLOOM_KERNEL_AGENT_ROOT"
export WORKSPACE_PATH="${WORKSPACE_PATH:-/workspace}"
export PYTHON="${PYTHON:-$(command -v python3)}"
export PATH="$(dirname "$PYTHON"):/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:${PATH:-}"

"$PYTHON" -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli --help
```

Then run the outer launcher preflight (IR-1):

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$REPO_ROOT/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/tools/preflight_optimizer.py" "$MODEL_PATH" \
  || { echo "preflight failed — aborting launch"; exit 1; }
```

A non-zero exit indicates GPU occupancy above the allowed threshold, a stale
serving process, or an unreadable GPU state. Do not continue to
`python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize` in any of these cases.

Do not manually pip-install SDKs, start Ray, or
`curl /v1/models` unless debugging a failed preflight. `_preflight()` and
`install.sh` own those repairs.

## Launch New Optimization

Set `$USER_DATA_PATH` to the workspace root, not the session dir. For sandboxes
that do not persist exports across shell calls, copy
`src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/setup_env.sh.example` to a **session-scoped** path:
`$USER_DATA_PATH/optimizer_runs/setup_env_${CLAW_SESSION_ID:-$(date +%s)}.sh`,
fill in the workload block, and source it on each call.

**IMPORTANT**: never use a shared filename like `setup_env.sh` — concurrent
sessions on different pods share `$USER_DATA_PATH` via WekaFS; a single file
causes MODEL_PATH race conditions where sessions launch the wrong model.

```bash
set -e
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
INSTALL_SH="${REPO_ROOT}/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh"
if [ ! -f "$INSTALL_SH" ]; then
  INSTALL_SH="${REPO_ROOT}/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh"
fi
. "${INSTALL_SH%/*}/runtime_env.sh"
load_dotenv_no_clobber
export USER_DATA_PATH
# Resolve the launch interpreter in this shell; preflight loads generated runtime state.
export PYTHON="${PYTHON:-$(command -v python3)}"
export PATH="$(dirname "$PYTHON"):/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
export RUN_TAG="$(basename "$MODEL_PATH")-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
export RUN_DIR="${USER_DATA_PATH:-/workspace/hyperloom}/optimizer_runs"
export RUN_LOG="$RUN_DIR/run_${RUN_TAG}.log"
export PID_FILE="$RUN_DIR/run_${RUN_TAG}.pid"
export LAUNCH_INFO_FILE="$RUN_DIR/launch_${RUN_TAG}.json"
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"

# $RUN_TAG is timestamped and cannot be recomputed. Persist the run-scoped vars
# so later blocks can source them: under Claw the launch is its own background
# tool call and the health check is a separate foreground call, which inherits
# none of these exports. Session-scoped filename for the same WekaFS reason
# setup_env.sh must never be shared; set $RUN_ENV yourself if two non-Claw runs
# share a host.
export RUN_ENV="$RUN_DIR/run_env_${CLAW_SESSION_ID:-$(hostname)}.sh"
printf 'export RUN_TAG=%q RUN_DIR=%q RUN_LOG=%q PID_FILE=%q LAUNCH_INFO_FILE=%q\n' \
  "$RUN_TAG" "$RUN_DIR" "$RUN_LOG" "$PID_FILE" "$LAUNCH_INFO_FILE" > "$RUN_ENV"

python3 -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli --verbose optimize \
  --model "$MODEL_PATH" \
  --framework "${FRAMEWORK:-sglang}" \
  --target-gain "${TARGET_GAIN:-10}" \
  --max-hours "${MAX_HOURS:-5}" \
  --tick-interval-sec 30 \
  --launch-info-file "$LAUNCH_INFO_FILE" \
  > "$RUN_LOG" 2>&1 < /dev/null
```

**Detach it the way the harness understands.** When `$CLAW_SESSION_ID` is set
*and* your bash tool takes a `run_in_background` parameter, hand that block to it
with `run_in_background=true` — no `setsid nohup`, no trailing `&`. Otherwise
prefix the `python3 ... optimize` command with `setsid nohup`, append ` &`, and
`echo $! > "$PID_FILE"`; that form is required for runs longer than 5 minutes
under Cursor. See the **Launch** section of `SKILL.md` for why the distinction
matters: a hand-detached run is invisible to Claw, and the sandbox is reclaimed
about fifteen minutes after the agent turn ends, with the run still going.

Either way, reconcile `$PID_FILE` to the **real** optimizer PID, which the CLI
records as `.pid` in the launch-info JSON. Under `setsid`, `$!` may be a wrapper
that exits immediately; on the background-tool path the tool returns a
`shell_id`, not a pid. A dead wrapper is not evidence that the optimizer needs
restarting.

When no authoritative pid can be had — no `.pid` in the launch-info JSON and a
`pgrep` that is empty or ambiguous — **delete** `$PID_FILE` instead of leaving
the wrapper pid in it. A missing pidfile means the optimizer PID is unknown,
not that it stopped. Inspect the launch log and persisted state before making
an explicit recovery decision; never resume automatically.

Health-check after 30 seconds in a **separate foreground tool call**, not
appended to the background launch block. Source `$RUN_ENV` again because that
shell inherits none of the launch block's exports. The launch-info JSON carries
the authoritative `.pid` and `.session_dir`; `jq` is not guaranteed on every
node, so use a tiny `python3` reader:

```bash
sleep 30
# Separate shell from the launch under Claw, so re-source the run-scoped env
# instead of assuming $RUN_DIR/$PID_FILE/$LAUNCH_INFO_FILE carried over.
RUN_ENV="${RUN_ENV:-${USER_DATA_PATH:-/workspace/hyperloom}/optimizer_runs/run_env_${CLAW_SESSION_ID:-$(hostname)}.sh}"
. "$RUN_ENV"
read_json() { python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1])).get(sys.argv[2],''))" "$1" "$2" 2>/dev/null; }

# Real optimizer PID (NOT the setsid wrapper in $!): take it from launch-info
# and rewrite $PID_FILE for accurate process checks.
REAL_PID="$(read_json "$LAUNCH_INFO_FILE" pid)"
if [ -z "$REAL_PID" ]; then
  # Best-effort only, and UNSAFE when several sessions optimize on this host:
  # the pattern matches all of them and nothing in it ties a hit to this run.
  # Accept it only when unambiguous; never `head -1` a multi-hit list, which
  # silently adopts another session's pid and reports the wrong process.
  MATCHES="$(pgrep -f 'hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli .*optimize' || true)"
  N_MATCHES="$(printf '%s\n' "$MATCHES" | grep -c . || true)"
  if [ "$N_MATCHES" = "1" ]; then
    REAL_PID="$MATCHES"
  else
    echo "ERROR: no .pid in $LAUNCH_INFO_FILE and pgrep is ambiguous" \
         "($N_MATCHES matches); refusing to guess. Inspect the" \
         "HYPERLOOM_LAUNCH line and $RUN_LOG." >&2
  fi
fi
if [ -n "$REAL_PID" ]; then
  echo "$REAL_PID" > "$PID_FILE"
else
  # A stale wrapper pid is not the optimizer's identity. Missing means unknown;
  # inspect the launch log and persisted state without restarting anything.
  rm -f "$PID_FILE"
  echo "WARN: removed $PID_FILE (no authoritative pid); inspect $RUN_LOG" \
       "and persisted state. Do not auto-resume." >&2
fi
# Not `test -d /proc/$pid`: a zombie keeps its /proc entry and sandbox PID 1
# does not reap, so that check reports a dead optimizer as alive indefinitely.
# Ask for the process state and reject Z.
ps -o stat= -p "$REAL_PID" 2>/dev/null | grep -qv '^Z' \
  && echo "optimizer_alive=true pid=$REAL_PID"

SESSION_DIR="$(read_json "$LAUNCH_INFO_FILE" session_dir)"
if [ -z "$SESSION_DIR" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: no .session_dir in $LAUNCH_INFO_FILE; inspect HYPERLOOM_LAUNCH and $RUN_LOG" >&2
  return 1 2>/dev/null || exit 1
fi

test -f "$SESSION_DIR/manifest.json" && echo "manifest_present=true session_dir=$SESSION_DIR"
test -f "$SESSION_DIR/state.json" && echo "state_exists=true"
```

Under Claw, prefer `bash_output` on the returned `shell_id` for harness liveness;
keep the zombie-aware `ps` check for the optimizer PID. Health checks only observe
and reconcile launch metadata; they must not kill, restart, or automatically
resume the optimizer.

## Resume Existing Session

`--resume-from "$SESSION_DIR"` is the only way to resume; the CLI never
chooses a session for you. Take `$SESSION_DIR` from the launch-info JSON or
the `HYPERLOOM_LAUNCH` line, never from the newest timestamp dir under
`$USER_DATA_PATH/<model>/`. Keep `$USER_DATA_PATH` at the workspace root
so `runtime/kernel-agent.env.sh` resolves. The named session must contain
`manifest.json` and `state.json`.

Reuse the launch template with these diffs: drop `--model`, add
`--resume-from "$SESSION_DIR"`, and set
`RUN_TAG="resume-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"`. Set `$FRAMEWORK` when resuming a
non-default session.

## Monitoring

Read persisted state on each requested status check; do not start a background
watchdog or automatic resume loop. A stopped process requires explicit diagnosis
and an operator decision before resuming the same session.

```bash
RUN_ENV="${RUN_ENV:-${USER_DATA_PATH:-/workspace/hyperloom}/optimizer_runs/run_env_${CLAW_SESSION_ID:-$(hostname)}.sh}"
. "$RUN_ENV"
read_json() { python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1])).get(sys.argv[2],''))" "$1" "$2" 2>/dev/null; }
export SESSION_DIR="$(read_json "$LAUNCH_INFO_FILE" session_dir)"
test -n "$SESSION_DIR"
"$PYTHON" "$REPO_ROOT/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/tools/read_optimizer_state.py" "$SESSION_DIR"
python3 "$REPO_ROOT/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/tools/event_counts.py" "$SESSION_DIR"
```

`stop_reason` meanings, read `troubleshooting.md`.
