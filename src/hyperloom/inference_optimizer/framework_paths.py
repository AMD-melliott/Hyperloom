"""Framework source-root resolution.

Centralises probe order across container layouts (``/sgl-workspace/...``,
``/app/ATOM/atom``, ``/app/xDiT``, site/dist-packages) so navigation hints,
AST discovery, install.sh, and ``apply_kernel_patch`` all agree. First-class
frameworks: atom, sglang, vllm, xdit (``xfuser`` package); aiter is discovered
as a shared kernel library.

Three resolvers, three questions, not interchangeable.
:func:`resolve_framework_tree` names *the* tree a session is optimising, keyed by
the framework's own name. :func:`resolve_kernel_search_roots` lists the trees
worth searching, filtered to what exists here. :func:`resolve_known_source_prefixes`
matches a path string against every layout that could hold source, including
those absent from this host. None is a permission set: what may be written is
decided by the integration step that applies the patch.
