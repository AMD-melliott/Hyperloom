    The check that matters is not "does this build have the flags" -- measured:
    the previous pin (aiperf 0.8.0) carries ``weka-trace``, ``--scenario`` and
    ``--benchmark-duration``, and even defines a scenario by the same name, yet
    its invariants differ (no ``require_streaming``, a 60s trace idle-gap cap
    against the current 10s system cap, no profile-metric coverage floor). What
    separates the two is the scenario's own loader allowlist: the current corpus
    is simply not in the old one.

    So this asks the aiperf that will actually run whether its scenario admits
    the corpus we are about to hand it -- the invariant itself rather than a
    proxy for it. That also closes the path a flag probe cannot see: an operator
    pinning an OLDER corpus via ``WEKA_LOADER_OVERRIDE`` (upstream's own H100
    recipes do) lands in the stale build's allowlist and would otherwise replay
    it under the wrong invariants and stamp the result submittable.

    Managed installs must expose the allowlist through their own interpreter.
    Legacy layouts and explicit overrides may fall back to the flag probe,
    loudly, when the allowlist cannot be read at all.

        aiperf_bin: Resolved aiperf path (None/empty means "not found").

        probe: Injectable help-text probe, used for the fallback path.
        loader_probe: Injectable allowlist probe; returns the scenario's
            permitted loaders, or None when they cannot be determined.
        env: Environment the benchmark will run with, including any corpus pin.
