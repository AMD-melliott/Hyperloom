"""Runtime repair of the AgentX aiperf dependency.

``HYPERLOOM_AGENTX`` declares aiperf as a required, version-pinned dependency,
and ``install.sh`` already knows how to install it (``ensure_aiperf``, pinned to
``AIPERF_REF`` in lockstep with ``INFERENCEX_REF``). What was missing is that the
install was conditioned on a *runtime* mode flag being true in the *installer's*
process, with nothing keeping the two moments consistent: provision without
``HYPERLOOM_AGENTX``/``INSTALL_AIPERF``, turn AgentX on later, and the box has no
aiperf. Both halves behaved as designed; the combination did not.

Measured: that gap sent a known, self-declared dependency into the enablement
lane, where an LLM specialist re-derived the install from scratch and had its
commands rejected by the setup-command allowlist -- spending the run's budget on
a problem this repository could already fix in one call. The preflight's own
error text names the fix ("install the pinned build via install.sh"), but it is
written for an operator, and on that path there is no operator.

So resolve it where the requirement is actually known. The runtime flag is the
single source of truth for "this box needs aiperf"; install-time opt-in stays a
pre-warm optimisation. Repair is attempted at most once per process (a second
attempt cannot succeed where the first failed, and a grid re-preflights every
round), and a failed repair is never silent -- it is folded into the preflight
error the caller surfaces, alongside the original diagnosis.
