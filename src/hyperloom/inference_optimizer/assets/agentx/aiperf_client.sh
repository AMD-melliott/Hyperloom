# aiperf_client.sh — AgentX benchmark client for Magpie's benchmark path.
#
# Design: DELEGATE the server phase to the maintained per-framework builtin
# (vllm_mi300x.sh / sglang_mi300x.sh) via MAGPIE_RUN_PHASE=server, so server
# boot + torch-profiler enabling stay correct across frameworks and versions
# (no profiler flags reimplemented here). MAGPIE_RUN_PHASE=client instead reuses
# a caller-managed server without launching, checking PIDs, or tearing it down.
# Then run `aiperf profile` (AgentX weka-trace scenario) as the client, and map
# its export into the InferenceX result schema. The client owns profiling: InferenceX's
# benchmark_serving.py self-triggers /start_profile, and aiperf does not, so
# when PROFILE=1 this script self-brackets a /start_profile..stop_profile window
# after AIPerf reports the measured phase through its progress API.
#
# Inputs (from Magpie env): MODEL, TP, PORT, MAX_MODEL_LEN, CONC, RESULT_DIR,
#   RESULT_FILENAME, PROFILE, EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS, FRAMEWORK, GPU_TYPE/RUNNER_TYPE,
#   AGENTX_CAPTURE_ID, AGENTX_CAPTURE_STATUS_PATH.
# AgentX knobs (AGENTX_ prefix; NOT AIPERF_, which aiperf's own settings read):
#   AGENTX_DATASET / WEKA_LOADER_OVERRIDE (pin the corpus loader),
#   AGENTX_NUM_ENTRIES (corpus cap; default 393 = all),
#   AGENTX_DURATION (measurement window; default 3600),
#   AGENTX_WARMUP_REQUESTS_PER_LANE (default 10),
#   AGENTX_WARMUP_GRACE_PERIOD (max drain wait; default 1800),
#   AGENTX_FAILED_REQUEST_THRESHOLD (error-rate abort ratio; default 0.10),
#   AGENTX_UNSAFE_OVERRIDE (opt into a sub-900s smoke; forces the run
#     non-submittable -- see the smoke note below),
#   AGENTX_REALTIME_METRICS (rolling stats block; default true),
#   AGENTX_DATASET_CONFIG_TIMEOUT (default 1800), AGENTX_LIVE_ASSISTANT,
#   AGENTX_HTTP_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT (no-TCP-progress bound in ms; default 900000,
#     matching upstream's long-context recipes -- aiperf's stock 30s aborts
#     live connections while the server is prefill-bound),
#   AGENTX_HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE_S (server-side idle timeout in s; default 900 -- the
#     other half of AGENTX_HTTP_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT. Exported as the framework's
#     own knob before the server boots; see the keep-alive note below),
#   AGENTX_MMAP_CACHE_DIR (dataset mmap cache; defaults under $HF_HUB_CACHE),
#   AGENTX_MAX_CTX (explicit opt-in client-side context cap; NEVER inferred
#     from $MAX_MODEL_LEN -- see the replay-context note below),
#   AGENTX_TRACE_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_S (how long to wait after /stop_profile for the
#     per-rank trace files to finish writing; default 1800. A 200 from
#     /stop_profile only means the tracer was told to stop -- measured on
#     GLM-5.3 TP=8, the 5.1 GB set was still being written 546s later),
#   AGENTX_TRACE_FIRST_FILE_TIMEOUT_S (separate, shorter bound for the case
#     where NO trace file appears at all -- a failed capture, not a slow one;
#     default 900, clamped to AGENTX_TRACE_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_S. The first rank file
#     landed at t+350s on that same GLM-5.3 capture),
#   AGENTX_KEEP_SERVER, AGENTX_PROFILE_WINDOW_S,
#   AGENTX_PROFILE_WARMUP_S (deprecated and ignored; phase-gated profiling
#     replaced the fixed warmup delay),
#   AGENTX_SERVER_SCRIPT (override builtin name), AIPERF_BIN.

  # ── Server-side keep-alive: the other half of AGENTX_HTTP_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT ────
  # AIPerf pins ONE pooled keep-alive connection per agentic session and reuses it
  # across that session's turns. The inter-turn gap in an agentic replay is a
  # model think-time, not a client delay, and routinely exceeds a serving
  # framework's default idle timeout -- vLLM's is 5s (envs.py:
  # ``VLLM_HTTP_TIMEOUT_KEEP_ALIVE: int = 5``). When the gap crosses it the server
  # closes the socket exactly as the client reuses it, and aiohttp surfaces
  # ServerDisconnectedError. AIPerf escalates that to a TERMINAL warmup failure:
  # "A root AgentX warmup request failed, so profiling was not started" -- against
  # a completely healthy server, with no error anywhere in the server log.
  #
  # Measured here on a conc=16 K3 round: the server logged an orderly
  # "Application shutdown complete" while warmup sat at 64/177, and the only
  # symptom was a burst of ServerDisconnectedError on the client. Upstream hit the
  # same failure (InferenceX #2371 aborted a c4 arm ~15 min in) and fixes it by
  # raising the SERVER idle timeout to match the client's tolerance.
  #
  # The client half already ships above as AIPERF_HTTP_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT (900s);
  # without this the two disagree by 180x. Exported per framework because the knob
  # name is framework-specific, and only when the operator has not pinned one.

  # first, and left SGLang on its 5s default -- while this very line went on to
  # report 900s. The server then closed the connection mid-warmup and the round
  # died as "root AgentX warmup request failed", with the log actively denying the
  # cause. BUILTIN is the script that actually boots, so it is the authority;

# ── Non-canonical workloads may run, but may never be submittable ────────────
# The scenario enforces a 900s duration floor, so a shortened AGENTX_DURATION is
# a hard startup abort rather than a quick run -- there would be no way to smoke
# test this path at all. Upstream opts into --unsafe-override below the floor.
#
# --unsafe-override alone is NOT sufficient to make a run non-submittable: aiperf
# stamps submission_valid=false only when the override actually suppressed a
# violation, so forcing the flag at the canonical 3600s (where there is nothing
# to suppress) leaves a fully KEEP-able result. And the scenario has no concept
# of corpus size at all, so shrinking AGENTX_NUM_ENTRIES to 50 traces produces
# submission_valid=true on a workload nothing on the leaderboard ran.
#
# So Hyperloom stamps the verdict itself. Every deviation from the canonical
# workload is collected here and handed to map_aiperf.py, which forces
# submission_valid=false with these reasons attached; benchmark_result.py then
# refuses the measurement. A smoke can be run, and can never be mistaken for a
# leaderboard measurement -- by construction rather than by promise.
CANON_ENTRIES=393
CANON_DURATION=3600
# Warmup is measurement-defining and was missing from this list until a measured
# run exposed the gap: the agentic warmup is what puts the KV/radix cache under
# realistic pressure before the window opens, so replaying at 1 request/lane
# instead of 10 measures a materially emptier cache. It carries no scenario
# marker either -- aiperf has no concept of "how much warmup is enough" -- so a
# reduced-warmup round came back submission_valid=true and looked publishable.
# On a 743B model the canonical 10/lane is a ~2h warmup, which is exactly when
# an operator reaches for this knob, so the hole was reachable in practice.
# (CANON_WARMUP_PER_LANE/CANON_WARMUP_GRACE are declared above, alongside
# WARMLANE/WARMGRACE, so the canonical value and the default can't drift apart.)
# The corpus this model family canonically replays, before any operator pin.
# CANON_DS is resolved with the corpus above. The family whitelist behind it is
# a derivation, not a registry -- a model upstream runs on the full corpus but
# whose slug does not match falls back to the 256k set, and the corpus log line
# tells the operator to pin the right one. Flagging that pin as a deviation
# would make the correct run permanently non-submittable, which is why
# AGENTX_CANONICAL_DATASET exists as a second, explicit knob: pinning alone
# still counts as a deviation.
NONCANON=()
# A pinned corpus is a different workload, and the scenario cannot object: its
# allowlist admits every dated weka variant, so replaying the 061526 set (which
# upstream's own H100/H200 recipes pin) comes back submission_valid=true against
# a leaderboard row measured on 062126. Only the client knows which one this
# model family was supposed to replay, so only the client can say it deviated.

# canonical measures a strictly cleaner run. Compared with awk because the
