# Program: rewrite `{spec.op_name}` to FlyDSL (correctness first)

## Objective
Port the source kernel(s) `{targets}` (in `{spec.source_kernel_name}`) into an
equivalent **FlyDSL** kernel written in `{candidate}`. This phase is
about CORRECTNESS: the FlyDSL output must match the original kernel within the SNR
gate (>= {spec.snr_threshold:g} dB). A later phase optimizes it; here, just make it correct.

## Interface contract (MUST match exactly)
`{candidate}` MUST define a factory `{builder}(...)` that returns a
launch callable. The EXACT argument signatures (order, count, meaning) are defined
by the measurement driver below: it imports `{builder}`, calls it to build the
kernel, then calls the returned launch callable each run. Match those calls
exactly. {entry_hint}
## Measurement driver (READ-ONLY — defines how your kernel is called + checked)
```python
{driver}
```

{source_heading}
```{fence}
{source}
```

## Rules
- Implement in FlyDSL ONLY (import flydsl...). Do NOT call {banned} to
  compute the result — that defeats the rewrite.
- Edit ONLY `{candidate}`. `{spec.source_kernel_name}`, the driver,
  and any harness define the reference/measurement; editing them is blocked.
- Expose the `{builder}` factory and match the launch signature the driver calls.
- Consult the FlyDSL knowledge (operator cards, API docs, examples) before
  writing — work from the docs, not from memory.
