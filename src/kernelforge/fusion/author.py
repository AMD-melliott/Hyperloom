  Triton kernel, one program per (token, k-head). +14.7% e2e alone.
- ZAYA ResidualScaling (`ZAYA_FUSED_RESIDUAL`): dual affine `(x+bias)*scale` on the
  hidden AND residual streams in ONE launch, bf16->fp32 in-kernel. QK+Residual
  together = +34.5% e2e.
- LFM2 (`LFM2_FUSED_RESIDUAL` / `LFM2_FUSED_SILU`): thread the per-layer residual
  adds into the next RMSNorm; merge w1|w3 SwiGLU into one GEMM + fused SiluAndMul.
  ~+16% e2e.
- Granite (`GRANITE_FUSED_RESIDUAL`): `scaled_add_rmsnorm` = `rmsnorm(x*scale + r)`,
  folding scalar-mul + residual-add + RMSNorm into ONE kernel; ~5e-9 vs eager.

## MANDATORY patterns from these serving-validated kernels
## (violating them passes microbench but CRASHES real serving — do NOT):
1. env-gated: with the flag UNSET the path is bit-for-bit the original eager code.
2. fp32 accumulation INSIDE the Triton kernel (cast bf16->fp32 in-kernel, not outside).
3. ONE Triton launch replacing the whole tiny-op chain (fewer launches = the win).
4. CUDA-GRAPH SAFE (CRITICAL): the kernel runs INSIDE the captured decode CUDA graph.
   Preallocate ALL outputs; use tl.constexpr for shapes; NO python-side allocation,
   NO `.item()`/`.cpu()`/torch host sync, NO data-dependent shapes in the decode hot
   path. A kernel that allocates or host-syncs per call passes a standalone microbench
   but SIGQUIT-crashes the sglang scheduler decode loop.
5. import the REAL eager op as the parity oracle; keep public signatures/imports intact.
6. ROCm-native Triton only; never reuse a CUDA-only framework fused op.

{chr(10).join(f"  - {h}" for h in hints)}

{integration_block}{proven_fusion_fewshot()}## Engineering discipline (MUST follow)
- The kernel MUST be REACHED by the decode path, not merely defined and exposed.
  Assigning it onto another module (`other_mod.my_fused_op = ...`) does nothing
  unless something already reads that name -- check that a reader exists before
  you rely on it. When the chain you are fusing lives in a file you may not edit,
  take over the call site from the file you may: rebind the method or attribute
  the chain already goes through, so the existing callers reach your kernel
  without changing any signature. Publishing a new name that nothing calls scores
  as a failed attempt, and it is the most common way a correct kernel is wasted.
- If you cannot reach the chain from the files you are allowed to touch, say so
  explicitly in your final message instead of leaving an unreachable kernel
  behind. That answer is useful; an inert one is not.
- The fusion MUST be env-gated by `{env_flag}`. With the flag UNSET the code path
  stays bit-for-bit the original eager path.
{rocm_line}- Cast to fp32 inside the fused kernel; one launch instead of the multi-op chain.
- NET launch count must DROP. Count the kernels the eager path launches per decode
  step and the kernels the fused path launches; the fused number must be strictly
  smaller. A scratch-fill, a separate cast or a contiguous copy added to feed your
  kernel can cancel the launches it saved while the chain alone still benchmarks
  faster. Report both counts alongside the speedup.
- CUDA-graph safe: no Python-side dynamic allocation or host sync in the decode
  hot path (preallocate outputs; use tl.constexpr for shapes).
- Keep all public function/class signatures and imports intact.
- Add a pure-torch reference and assert parity BEFORE trusting the kernel.
  {recipe.get("eager_reference_hint")}
- If Triton is unavailable, fall back to eager (never crash).
{harness_block}
## How to validate (the ONLY success signal)
Run this A/B (boots the model twice; eager vs `{env_flag}=1`), decode-step median:
    {ab_hint}
- SUCCESS = fused clearly faster than eager (target speedup >= {target_speedup:.2f}x).
- Also confirm correctness: greedy output with the flag on stays coherent vs off.
- Iterate: edit -> run A/B -> read speedup -> fix -> repeat until the target is met.

When done, print: `AUTHORING_RESULT: env_flag={env_flag} speedup=<X>x files=<edited files>` and stop.
Do not edit the A/B harness or hard-code any numbers.
