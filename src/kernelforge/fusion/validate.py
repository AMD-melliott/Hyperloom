"""Kernel-level validation of an authored fusion (Phase 4; e2e is out of scope).

forge-fuse validates at the KERNEL level, NOT full serving e2e (that is
Hyperloom's job). The validator this module provides is:

* :func:`validate_recipe` -- the fine-grained, GPU-optional KERNEL validator used
  by the autoloop (see ``loop.py``). Given a :class:`~kernelforge.fusion.models.Recipe`
  and an injectable :class:`KernelValidationRunner`, it runs three gates and
  returns a :class:`~kernelforge.fusion.models.ValidationResult`:

    (a) COMPILE/IMPORT -- the fused kernel module must import and, if Triton,
        JIT-compile on this GPU arch. "Diagnosed headroom that cannot build on
        ROCm" is a hard FAIL (e.g. reusing a framework CUDA-only op such as
        ``fused_qk_norm_rope`` which pulls in ``cuda_bf16.h``).
    (b) NUMERICAL PARITY vs the REAL eager op -- compared with the shared SNR
        gate or an rtol fallback, NEVER strict allclose (bf16 + fp32-accum is
        not bit-exact).
    (c) MICROBENCH speedup -- ``eager_us`` vs ``fused_us``; the speedup must
        clear ``target_speedup`` and stay under this module's own absolute
        plausibility ceiling.
    (d) LAUNCH COUNT -- ``fused_launches`` must be strictly below
        ``eager_launches``. Launches are what a fusion buys, and a chain that
        times faster while adding a scratch-fill or a cast elsewhere has bought
        nothing; counts the harness could not measure leave this unverified
        rather than passed.

``kept`` requires (a) through (d).

The GPU/import work lives entirely behind the injectable ``KernelValidationRunner``
so the orchestration + parity math + ROCm failure-mode classification are unit
testable WITHOUT a GPU (tests pass a fake runner). Known ROCm failure modes are
encoded as first-class classifiers (:func:`classify_compile_error`,
:func:`classify_bench_skip`) so the loop's experience ledger learns the right
lesson (author Triton, not the framework CUDA op; skip the microbench when the
Mamba backend cannot init on ROCm).

    A fused kernel can pass the kernel-level harness (small shapes, no CUDA graph)

    (HSA_STATUS_ERROR_EXCEPTION) once it runs inside the captured decode CUDA graph
    over varying token counts (e.g. a data-dependent grid or a per-call allocation).
    Launches serving with the fusion env flags ON, runs a short decode probe, and
    returns a :class:`SmokeVerdict` naming the stage that failed and whether the
    kernel is implicated. The reason is fed back into the autoloop experience
    ledger so the NEXT author attempt fixes the CUDA-graph bug -- but only when
    ``blames_kernel``, because re-authoring cannot fix an environment.

    ``framework`` selects the launcher/probe (``vllm`` / ``vllm-aiter`` vs ``sglang``);
    it MUST match the target framework or the server never boots. ``launcher_exe``
    pins WHICH install serves (else the first one on ``PATH`` wins, which need not
    be the install that was probed and edited).

    ``metrics``, when given, receives measured decode throughput plus fusion-pass
    activation evidence, so a caller can compare two arms instead of only asking

    A fusion is delivered as two edits: a new fused-kernel module, and a wiring

    it against its own eager reference, so a 37x microbench is fully explained by
    a module that nothing calls; and the serving smoke boots the framework and
    sends real decodes, which succeed exactly as they did before because the
