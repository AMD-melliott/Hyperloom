## Where the fused kernel goes (MANDATORY)
Write the fused kernel into exactly this file, which already exists and is empty:
    {fused_module}
{other_modules_rule} Only {tracked_phrase} are tracked, and the
loop can neither keep nor revert anything else — a kernel written elsewhere scores
as a validated candidate that then vanishes.

## Wiring it in is HALF THE DELIVERABLE (MANDATORY)
A fused module that nothing calls is not a fusion. You are not done when the kernel
is fast in the harness; you are done when the framework's own forward path runs it.
So the change you leave behind must be a patch that applies to the framework tree
and is complete on its own:
  1. REPLACE the original call site. Find where the framework's forward path issues
     the chain you fused and make it call your entry point under {recipe.env_flag},
     falling back to the untouched chain when the flag is off. Edit the framework
     source above (and the additional in-scope files, if the fix spans them).
  2. Move EVERY part of the fusion into the framework. If the fusion needs its
     input produced differently — a GEMM that stops casting its output, a tensor
     left in its original dtype or layout — that change belongs at the producing
     call site in the framework, not in the harness and not in a caller's head.
     Whatever the harness would have to do to set up your kernel is, by definition,
     part of the fusion you have not delivered yet.
  3. Leave the flag-off path byte-identical to what it was.
The loop reverts anything outside the tracked files, so a wiring edit written
elsewhere disappears along with the score it earned.

## The single entry point (MANDATORY)
Export exactly ONE public function from the fused module, and have both the
framework call site and the harness call THAT SAME function. It must take the
values available at the call site and return what the original chain returned, so
that wiring it in is a one-line substitution and the harness's fused arm is a
single call with no preparation around it. If the harness has to run part of your
fusion before calling you, the entry point is drawn at the wrong boundary: pull
that work inside it.

Name it in a module-level attribute so the harness can find it:
    __forge_fused_entry__ = "<name of that function>"
The harness was written before your module existed and resolves the function
through this attribute, so a module without it is a module the harness cannot
call — it will score your fusion as absent.
