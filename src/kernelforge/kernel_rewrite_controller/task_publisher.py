#: How long a staged directory must stop changing before it is taken. The agent
#: writes task.json and driver.py in separate tool calls and neither write is
#: atomic, so the pair existing does not mean the pair is finished.
PUBLISH_QUIESCENT_SEC = 5.0

#: What an agent writes into ``task.json`` to take a draft back. It has no tool
#: that can delete a directory -- the analysis session runs without a shell, and
#: Write cannot remove -- so withdrawing has to be something it can write. Any
#: draft whose task.json carries this key is neither published nor counted as
#: refused, and the Stop hook stops holding the session open for it.
WITHDRAWN_KEY = "withdrawn"

#: Where a refusal is left for the agent to read, inside the draft it refused.
#: Validation runs out of process on a timer, so there is no tool result to
#: return the reason on; without a file the agent finishes the session believing
#: it published, which is the failure this whole path exists to prevent. The
#: name is stable so the prompt can point at it.
REJECTION_FILENAME = "rejection.json"

#: What the detector answers when no known package owns a path, and what it folds
#: every spelling of "this kernel belongs to no package" to. Read from the
#: detector rather than spelled out so the two cannot drift.
