EDIT_SURFACE_AND_SWEEPS_PROMPT = """\
## Edit surface & cheap sweeps (shared cards — read before pricing a direction)

Both live under `common_methodology/optimization/` in the knowledge tree. Open
them with the `Read` tool; what follows is the part you must not have to look up.

- **`lever_edit_surface.md` — `editable_sources` is a FLOOR, not a ceiling, and
  it never bounds WHAT YOU CHANGE.** The planning context lists the campaign's
  declared source set there (entry 0 is the primary kernel path; data and config
  files count exactly as much as `.py` sources); every other tracked,
  non-protected implementation file is editable too, and you may add new files.
  From a permitted file you can rebind a symbol in an installed package before
  the framework consumes it; carry device-side source in through the framework's
  own hook (`import_source`, `pragma_import_c`, an intrinsic, inline asm) and
  call it on the extern-call path; change a module-level constant that another
  module's dispatch reads; or append a row to a permitted data/config file that
  a lookup consults. Those are instances of one move — find the last point,
  reachable from a file you may edit, at which the behaviour is still mutable,
  and change it there — not a list of four routes to enumerate and close.
  A constant whose default comes from `os.environ` is an ordinary constant in an
  editable file: an `os.environ.get(...)` default says NOTHING about the edit
  surface. Writing "that would mean patching the framework/library, not this
  file" has already cost a campaign its largest available win; before you write
  it, work out what actually runs first from the files you were given. Reaching a
  constant someone else reads from the environment is in scope; authoring a new
  environment read in the kernel you submit is not.
- **`lever_cheap_sweeps.md` — to time one constant, do not edit-and-gate.** Read
  the constant on the host as `FORGE_SWEEP_<NAME>` defaulting to today's value,
  echo `sweep_const: <NAME> <value>` on every read (a point with no echo fails and
  carries no time), parse a BOOLEAN knob against an explicit token set rather
  than with `bool(value)` (`bool("0")` is `True`, so the OFF point would time the
  ON kernel and the echo would still confirm it), and take one data point per
  command:
  `python3 -m kernelforge.mcp_server.tools.bench --driver <driver command> --case <CASE_ID> --set <NAME>=<value>`
  Pass `--driver` exactly the command you were told to run the driver with (name
  the WRAPPER when your session names one). Sweep coupled constants JOINTLY, and
  sweep every inherited literal in BOTH directions. Sweep numbers are
  exploratory; the canonical gate still decides what survives.
  **The knobs last one turn.** Instrument the kernel in place — the driver loads
  it from where the task put it, so a copy elsewhere is a file it never runs —
  and before you end the turn, replace every `FORGE_SWEEP_` read with the literal
  it selected, delete the echo, and re-run the driver on the file you submit.
  What carries an axis to the next session is the constant you name in this
  iteration's lesson — the values you timed and what they cost — not a knob left
  behind in the shipped file for someone to mistake for live configuration."""
