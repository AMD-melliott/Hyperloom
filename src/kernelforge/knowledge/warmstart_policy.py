"""How wide, how cheap and how long a KB warm start is allowed to search.

Two independent warm starts read these: the forge loop's and the FlyDSL rewrite path's. They address different

#: The lowest claimed speedup worth spending a trial on. A trial's cost scales with how slow the candidate is, since
#: the correctness suite and the benchmark both run the kernel, so a port orders of magnitude off the pace can spend

#: well-populated identity spends hours before the agent's first edit. On expiry the best already measured is adopted.
