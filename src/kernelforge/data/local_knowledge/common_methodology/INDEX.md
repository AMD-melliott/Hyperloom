# Common optimization methodology — knowledge map

This file is the entry index for everything under `common_methodology/`. It gives
(1) what this knowledge base covers and how it is organized, (2) for a given task/symptom, **which files
to read and in what order**, and (3) the role of every file and folder.

> **Convention (KernelForge standard):** a knowledge folder that contains an `INDEX.md` is navigated
> **through this file** — load it whole. Folders without an `INDEX.md` fall back to a generated
> "filename — one-line description" listing.

## What this knowledge base is
The **backend-agnostic reasoning layer** between hardware facts and a concrete kernel implementation. It
answers "given a slow kernel, *how do I find the real bottleneck* and *which general lever fixes it*?"
independent of the kernel language. It sits **above** `hardware/` (the metal + concrete numbers) and
**below** the language/framework folders (`languages/{hip,triton,gluon,flydsl,ck,asm}/`, `framework/`)
that turn a chosen lever into code. Everything here is grounded in **CDNA4 (gfx950 / MI350X·MI355X)**
facts — `hardware/` covers gfx950 only.

It is organized on **two axes** — *diagnosis* then *treatment*:
- **`profiling/`** — **how to measure and classify**: benchmark honestly, build a roofline, and read the
  four bottleneck classes off the counters. This is where an optimization loop *starts*.
- **`optimization/`** — **the levers**: one file per technique, each tied to the hardware fact it exploits
  and the bottleneck class it addresses. Has its own hand-written section index at
  `optimization/LEVERS.md`.

**The load-bearing rule:** *classify before you optimize.* Never pull an `optimization/` lever until
`profiling/` has told you which roof the kernel sits under — tuning MFMA on a bandwidth-bound norm (or
coalescing on a compute-bound GEMM) is wasted effort.

## Portable golden rules (internalize before optimizing)
- **Classify first.** Four failure modes: compute-bound, bandwidth-bound, occupancy-limited,
  latency-bound. Different roofs, different levers — place the kernel on the roofline before touching it.
- **Most inference kernels are HBM-bandwidth-bound** — optimize **bytes moved**, not FLOPs.
- **Peak ≠ achievable.** Tuned GEMM sustains only **~45–55% of theoretical matrix peak**
  (software-maturity ceiling). The bar is the **best tuned library kernel**, never the datasheet number.
- **Measure honestly.** Warm, **REPEATS=7**, inside the **~0.5% e2e noise band**, clocks locked/monitored,
  **same-session non-overlapping A/B**. A sub-band delta is not a result. Quote achieved, never peak.
- **Apply levers top-down** (algorithm/fusion → feed matrix cores → parallelism → memory → autotune the
  residual → keep it correct).
- **Loop *form* is an optimization axis, not only work volume.** `num_stages` pipelining and
  direct-to-LDS async copies require a **shape-static** trip count and addresses; a `while` bounded by
  a tensor load, or a `tl.load` addressed from another `tl.load`, disables both **silently**. A gather
  rewritten as "static range + mask" can do **2–4× more nominal work and still run ~2× faster**
  (measured, gfx950/Triton 3.6). Never reject a loop restructuring on block count alone
  (`optimization/lever_loop_form.md`).
- **Accumulate in fp32; verify every fast path** against an fp32 reference (`err_ratio < 0.05`), and watch
  the **fp8 FNUZ (CDNA3) vs OCP (CDNA4)** scale trap.
- **The editable list is a floor, not a ceiling, and it never bounds what you change.** A permitted file that runs first can
  rebind an installed package, carry device source through the framework's own hook, or hold the constant
  another module's dispatch reads — and a constant defaulted from `os.environ` is still an ordinary
  editable constant (`optimization/lever_edit_surface.md`).
- **Only aiter's per-shape DB engages the live sglang/vllm path** — triton `@autotune` and
  `hipblaslt-bench` tune authoring, not the deployed dispatch, unless rebound through aiter.

## Start here — problem → files → order
The canonical optimization loop reads across both folders: **benchmark a baseline → roofline → classify →
pick a lever → apply → re-benchmark A/B.** Paths are relative to this folder.

| Task / symptom | Read in this order |
|---|---|
| "Where do I even start on this kernel?" | `profiling/measure_protocol.md` (baseline) → `profiling/measure_roofline.md` → `profiling/measure_triage.md` → then a lever below |
| "Actually profile this kernel now / get its SoL+roofline / `rocprof-compute` won't run" | `profiling/measure_rocpc_workflow.md`, then run `python3 profiling/rocpc_profile.py --driver <driver> [--roofline]` → classify with `profiling/measure_triage.md` |
| "Classify it: compute / BW / occupancy / latency" | `profiling/measure_triage.md` → `optimization/lever_bottleneck_class.md` → `profiling/measure_roofline.md` |
| "Build / read a roofline on MI350X·MI355X" | `profiling/measure_roofline.md` → `optimization/lever_bottleneck_class.md` |
| "Compute-bound GEMM — feed the matrix cores" | `optimization/lever_mfma_sched.md` → `optimization/lever_prefetch.md` → `optimization/lever_lds_banks.md` → `optimization/lever_occupancy.md` |
| "Bandwidth-bound (norm / elementwise / decode GEMV / KV read)" | `optimization/lever_coalescing.md` → `optimization/lever_fusion.md` → `optimization/lever_xcd_locality.md` |
| "Low occupancy / register pressure / spilling / few waves/CU" | `optimization/lever_occupancy.md` → `optimization/lever_grid_sizing.md` |
| "Latency-bound — both roofs far, occupancy OK, high stall %" | `optimization/lever_prefetch.md` → `optimization/lever_grid_sizing.md` (more in-flight work) |
| "Sparse / top-k / paged-gather kernel — which loop should I even write?" | `optimization/lever_loop_form.md` → `optimization/lever_prefetch.md` → `profiling/measure_protocol.md` (A/B both loop forms) |
| "`num_stages` changes nothing / the pipelining knobs are ignored / `while` loop over a data-dependent index list" | `optimization/lever_loop_form.md` (a data-dependent trip count disables pipelining + async copy silently) → `optimization/lever_prefetch.md` |
| "LDS bank conflicts / `ds_read`·`ds_write` stalls / tile won't fit" | `optimization/lever_lds_banks.md` → `optimization/lever_prefetch.md` |
| "Chiplet locality / L2 reuse / tile swizzle / <1024 workgroups" | `optimization/lever_xcd_locality.md` → `optimization/lever_grid_sizing.md` |
| "Should I fuse these two ops?" | `optimization/lever_bottleneck_class.md` (re-classify first) → `optimization/lever_fusion.md` |
| "Wave/workgroup/grid sizing, `__launch_bounds__`, persistent kernels" | `optimization/lever_grid_sizing.md` → `optimization/lever_xcd_locality.md` |
| "Tune a GEMM for the live serving path" | `optimization/lever_autotune.md` → `profiling/measure_protocol.md` (validate via A/B) |
| "Time one constant fast / sweep a dispatch literal / where do the env knobs go?" | `optimization/lever_cheap_sweeps.md` (in place for one turn — the deliverable gets the literal) → `profiling/measure_protocol.md` (noise band) |
| "This lever needs a file I was not given / 'that means patching the framework, not this file'" | `optimization/lever_edit_surface.md` → `optimization/lever_cheap_sweeps.md` |
| "Is this constant editable? its default comes from `os.environ`" | `optimization/lever_edit_surface.md` (yes — it is a module constant in an editable file) |
| "Accuracy regressed / fp8 mismatch / softmax overflow / norm drift" | `optimization/lever_numerics.md` |
| "Did my change actually help? benchmark hygiene / A/B / noise band" | `profiling/measure_protocol.md` |

> **Naming convention.** Every card here is prefixed `lever_` (a technique you apply) or `measure_`

## Reading-depth guide (how much to load)
- **Just diagnosing** (which roof am I under?): `profiling/measure_triage.md` +
  `profiling/measure_roofline.md` — don't pull any lever yet.
- **Applying one lever**: load the single `optimization/` file for that technique; it names the
  `hardware/` cards it depends on. Consult `optimization/LEVERS.md` if unsure which lever fits.
- **A full optimization pass**: walk the whole loop — benchmark baseline → roofline → classify → lever →
  re-benchmark A/B — following the routing table top-to-bottom.
- **Correctness gate**: `optimization/lever_numerics.md` before shipping any fast path.

## Cross-links out of this folder
Methodology is the reasoning layer, not the source of numbers or code. For **concrete hardware numbers**
(peaks, cache sizes, opcode tables) see `hardware/` — **gfx950 only**; each lever cites the specific card.
For **kernel-language mechanics** see `languages/{hip,triton,gluon,flydsl,ck,asm}/`.

**Applying a lever to a specific operator:** the language folders no longer carry per-operator cards, and
this base does not maintain general operator knowledge — read the kernel source. `framework/aiter/` is the
library control plane: `framework/aiter/overall/tuning_db.md` is the canonical worked example of turning
a lever into a real change (capture shapes → tune the per-shape DB → prove engagement), and
`framework/aiter/overall/operator_catalog.md` gives the entry point and signature for each operator
family. There are no per-operator cards anywhere in this base — that knowledge goes stale faster than
it can be maintained.
