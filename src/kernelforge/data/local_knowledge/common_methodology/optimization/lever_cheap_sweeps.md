# cheap sweeps — measure the constant instead of arguing about it

## TL;DR
The acceptance benchmark answers one expensive question (the whole suite, scored as a single mean).
For "hold the source fixed, vary one dispatch constant, time one shape" use the **sweep primitive**:
expose the constant as `FORGE_SWEEP_<NAME>` with today's value as the default, echo
`sweep_const: <NAME> <value>` on every read, and call
`python3 -m kernelforge.mcp_server.tools.bench --driver <driver command> --case <CASE_ID> --set <NAME>=<value>`.
One sweep point is then one command instead of an edit plus a gate cycle, cheap enough to call
dozens of times inside one iteration. **The knobs last one turn: before you end it, replace each
read with the literal it selected, so the kernel you submit carries the winning literal, not the
read that found it.** A knob left in the deliverable is indistinguishable, to everyone downstream,
from live configuration.
What carries an axis to the next session is the constant you named in your lesson, not plumbing left
behind in the shipped file.

## The primitive

    python3 -m kernelforge.mcp_server.tools.bench \
        --driver <driver command> --case <CASE_ID> \
        --set BLOCK_H=32 --set NUM_WARPS=4

Pass `--driver` exactly the command you were told to run the driver with. If your session names a
wrapper (a lock is interposed when other lanes share this GPU), name the **wrapper** here, never the
raw driver: the raw driver is denied by the in-session gate, and it would time against another
lane's benchmark.

## Making a constant sweepable

Instrument the kernel where the task put it. The driver loads the kernel from that path, the one
the loop measures, so a copy anywhere else is a file no sweep point ever runs. Read the constant from
the host as `FORGE_SWEEP_<NAME>`, defaulting to the value in force today, echo every read, and
convert the string against the type of the default:

```python
_SWEEP_TRUE = {"1", "true", "yes", "on"}
_SWEEP_FALSE = {"0", "false", "no", "off"}

def _sweep_const(name, default):
    value = os.environ.get("FORGE_SWEEP_" + name)
    if value is None:
        return default
    print(f"sweep_const: {name} {value}", flush=True)
    if isinstance(default, bool):
        token = value.strip().lower()
        if token in _SWEEP_TRUE:
            return True
        if token in _SWEEP_FALSE:
            return False
        raise ValueError(f"FORGE_SWEEP_{name}: not a boolean: {value!r}")
    return type(default)(value)
```

**Do not drop the bool branch, and do not put it after the `int` case** — `bool` is a subclass of
`int`, and `bool("0")` and `bool("false")` are both `True`, so a bare `type(default)(value)` turns
every OFF point into a second measurement of the ON configuration. That is the one sweep bug the
echo cannot catch: the echo reports the string the *host sent*, never the value the *source
computed*, so `sweep_const: USE_FUSED_EPILOGUE 0` prints identically whether the kernel took the
fused path or not. Both ends of the axis then time the same code, agree inside the noise band, and
the sweep reports "this flag makes no difference" about a flag it never actually turned off — fully
confirmed, and wrong. Refuse an unrecognized token loudly rather than falling back to the default;
a point that silently times the default is the same wrong answer with a typo for a cause.

The echo is a **contract, not decoration**. A sweep whose knob is never actually read would
otherwise time the default twice and report "this constant does not matter" — the most expensive
kind of wrong answer, because it closes a live axis. A point under this prefix with no echo fails
and carries no time.

## A knob the source already reads under its own name

Instrumentation is only for constants that are currently bare literals. A constant the source
*already* reads from the environment under its own name needs none: pass `--verbatim-names` and
every `--set` name is exported exactly as written. That is the only way to reach a knob a
third-party or baseline module owns — a vendor library's `PKG_SMALL_BATCH_TILE`, a compiler's
`TRITON_*`, a framework's own dispatch bound — none of which will ever print forge's echo line.

Because no echo comes back, such a point returns marked **UNCONFIRMED**: nothing proves the source
read the value. The number means something only against a reference point taken with no `--set` at
all, in the same round. Take that reference first, or the sweep tells you nothing.

Names the measurement itself runs on are refused before any process starts — device selection,
toolchain paths, cache directories, `PATH`. Those are not knobs of the kernel, and a sweep that set
one would time something other than the configuration it claims to be timing.

## The knobs last one turn

A `FORGE_SWEEP_` knob is scaffolding for the question you are asking right now. It lives in the
kernel while you ask it, and is gone before the turn ends. Rules:

1. **Default every knob to the current winning literal.** The unset path must reproduce the
   committed number exactly, or every sweep point is measured against a kernel nobody reviewed.
2. **Collapse before you end the turn.** Replace every read with the literal it selected, delete the
   echo helper, and re-run the driver on the result: the collapsed kernel must still pass and must
   time inside the noise band of the winning point. This is the last edit of the turn, not a step
   left for someone later — a knob still in the file when the turn ends ships with it.
3. **Submit the literal.** What survives the sweep goes into the kernel you submit as a bare
   constant. The read that found it does not come across.
4. **Record the axis in the lesson, not in the file.** The next session inherits your lessons, not
   your knobs: name the constant, the values you timed, and what each cost. An axis recorded that
   way is re-opened with one edit; an axis nobody wrote down is one nobody asks about again.
5. **A knob is not a result.** Having made a constant sweepable does not make the axis "explored";
   the number you measured through it does.

## Sweep discipline

- **Sweep coupled constants JOINTLY.** A tile geometry timed at a launch config tuned for the *old*
  geometry is not a measurement of that tile, and a negative from such a point closes nothing.
- **Sweep in BOTH directions.** Every literal on the host dispatch path is a search variable, not a
  given — a floor, a cap, a minimum count, a bucket boundary nobody has questioned is exactly where
  an untested default hides. That includes a constant whose default comes from `os.environ`: it is
  an ordinary module constant in an ordinary file (see `[[optimization/lever_edit_surface.md]]`).
- **Sweep numbers are exploratory; the gate refuses them as evidence.** They tell you which edit to
  make; the gate still decides whether it survives.
- **Respect the noise band.** Read the reported `wall_min`/`wall_max` spread before believing a small
  difference, and re-run the point rather than ranking inside the band
  (`[[profiling/measure_protocol.md]]`).
- **A whole-suite point has no spread of its own.** A driver that ignores or rejects `--bench-case`
  times its whole suite instead; the requested case's time still stands and the result says so, but
  there are no per-iteration lines to read a spread from.
- **A build/run failure is not a slow result.** A configuration that will not build or will not run
  reports that, with no time attached. Never rank it as a measurement.

## Pitfalls
- Ending the turn with the knobs still in the kernel, and handing over a deliverable nobody can read
  without first working out which knobs are live and which are leftovers.
- Instrumenting a copy of the kernel instead of the kernel: the driver never loads it, every point
  fails for want of an echo, and the axis looks unreachable when it is not.
- A knob whose default does not equal the shipped literal: every un-swept run silently benchmarks a
  different kernel than the one under review.
- Sweeping one member of a coupled pair and reading the negative as a verdict on the axis.
- Treating a constant as out of reach because its default is read from the environment, or because it
  lives in a sibling module rather than the anchor file.
- Converting a swept value with `type(default)(value)` when the default is a bool: `bool("0")` is
  `True`, so the OFF point benchmarks the ON configuration and the echo confirms the point anyway.

## Verify
- Each accepted point echoed `sweep_const: <NAME> <value>` for every `--set` you passed.
- Each boolean point actually flipped. The echo proves the read, not the parse, so before you accept
  a flat boolean axis, show that the `0` and the `1` end reach different code — a differing log line,
  a differing build, a time outside the band.
- The instrumented kernel with nothing set reproduces the committed kernel's wall time inside the
  noise band — if it does not, a default is wrong and every point taken on it is about a different
  kernel.
- The winning literal survives the real gate, not only the sweep.
- The kernel you submit contains no `FORGE_SWEEP_` read and emits no `sweep_const:` echo, and the
  driver re-run after the collapse still passes; the axis you explored is named in the iteration's
  lesson instead.
