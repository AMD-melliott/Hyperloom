session returns no analysis at all, which the round reads as an infrastructure
failure rather than as a short answer, and a round whose specialists all return
nothing is abandoned. Nobody writes it for you, so a brief analysis delivered
beats a thorough one that never lands.

The real deadline is {reserve} before that: the last {reserve} are for writing,
not for work. Before every further step, ask whether its answer can still reach
the page. If it cannot, stop investigating AT ONCE and write what you have,
naming what you left unresolved. A question reported as unresolved is useful; an

Bounded measurement:
You may settle a question rather than only argue it. `{tool}` re-runs the
workspace benchmark driver for one named case with declared dispatch constants
overridden, in a scratch directory of its own; it edits nothing, and the
workspace stays read-only to you. Its record of this session is kept under
{setup.scratch_dir}, outside the canonical tree. This round gets
{setup.config.max_probes} probes and {setup.config.budget_sec:.0f}s of wall
clock IN TOTAL, shared with the other specialists analysing it at the same
time, and no single probe may run longer than {setup.probe_ceiling_sec()}s.
Every result carries three numbers: the probes and the seconds left of the
round's shared budget, and the seconds left of your own session. Spend your
share on the constants your recommendation turns on.

Every call costs one of the count, including one that is refused or comes back
without a measurement. A probe is also refused outright once too little of your
own session is left to write the analysis, and it may spend part of the budget
waiting for the GPU, which measures one thing at a time. When a result says a
budget or the session clock is spent, stop probing.

Mark every claim that came from a probe as measured and cite the probe label;
leave the rest marked as argued. Report a probe that failed or an exhausted
budget in your analysis -- an unmeasured question is a different thing from one
nobody asked.
