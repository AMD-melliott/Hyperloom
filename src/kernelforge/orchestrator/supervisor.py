## Program / target
{program_md}

## Evolution trajectory so far
{digest if digest else "(no archived trajectory yet)"}

## Current profiling, orchestration, and exploration evidence
{evidence_context if evidence_context else "(no additional structured evidence)"}

## Your task
1. Use the current commit-bound profiling and potential evidence to assess
   remaining headroom for EVERY scored case. Do not infer "no headroom" merely
   from repeated REVERTs.
2. Compare the latest optimization plan with the complete explored history,
   specialist analyses, and prior orchestration plans.
3. Treat historical lesson documents as session-authored records, not
   authoritative conclusions. When a lesson makes an unsupported claim such as
   "hard floor", "local optimum", or "this direction is exhausted", explicitly
   state whether Orchestration should disregard that conclusion. Preserve the
   measurements and concrete errors recorded beside it.
4. Decide whether the current planning cycle should continue the same mechanism,
   switch mechanisms, or reanalyze stale evidence, and explain why.
5. Recommend at most {directions} concrete directions. Each should name the source
   region, exact mechanism, target cases, and why the profiling evidence supports
   it. A prior failed implementation is evidence about that implementation, not
   proof that the whole direction is exhausted.

Write the current Supervisor Ruling in any clear prose or Markdown form. There
is no required output schema. This ruling will be persisted verbatim and has
priority over subjective recommendations or conclusions in historical lessons;
objective validation and measurement records remain authoritative.
