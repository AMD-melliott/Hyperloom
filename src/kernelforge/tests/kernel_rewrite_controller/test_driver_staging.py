"""A task's driver has to run from inside the repository it measures.

The published task directory is not in the repository. A driver run from there
is external to the workspace, and forge-loop then hands its preparation agent a
staging directory instead of the workspace -- which the agent's safety guard
refuses, because it is not a Git checkout. Every task whose driver needs repair
dies there, and a collective task always needs repair: the analyst is told to
hand over a single-process driver and leave the ranks to the preparer.
