"""What the graph probe concludes about a multi-rank measurement.

The probe asks two things of a collective task: that the declared ranks really
launched, and that every one of them measured inside ``dist_harness``. It does
not re-derive how the run behaved. The harness owns device binding, per-rank
seeding, barrier placement, the cross-rank reduction and the teardown, so a rank
that ran inside it holds those by construction -- and a rank that did not is
refused for that rather than for whichever of them it broke first.
