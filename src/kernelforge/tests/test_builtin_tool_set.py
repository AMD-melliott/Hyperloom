"""The base tool set handed to the CLI, which is what the prefix is made of.

``allowed_tools`` only says what a session is *permitted* to call; the CLI still
loads and describes every built-in tool, and those schemas live in the cached
prefix that is re-read on every turn. Measured on a one-turn session: 33,374
prefix tokens with the default set against 6,148 with the four an implementer
uses. Naming the base set is therefore worth ~27k tokens per turn, and on the
72-turn implementer session observed in a live campaign that is most of its
cache_read. These tests pin what reaches the SDK; they are GPU- and SDK-free.
