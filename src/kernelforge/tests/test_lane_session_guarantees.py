"""What protects an Implementer lane, and who is asked to guarantee it.

A lane edits its own copy of the workspace, and its candidate is measured later,
once, by the loop. The measurement surface still has to survive the session: a
lane diff that touches the driver, the harness or the oracle is refused at the
boundary, and the refusal takes the implementation edits in the same diff with
it -- after the session has already been paid for in full.

A hook denies that edit while the agent is still working, which is the only
point at which the rest of the session can still be saved. The lane runs the
in-session gate for those denials alone: the gate's Stop hook benchmarks, and
lanes run concurrently while the device measures one thing at a time.

That protection, and the private build cache a lane compiles into, are both
things the provider does on the lane's behalf. Neither is checked by the lane
code, so the second half of this file is about the provider being made to
declare them before a round of lanes is allowed to start.
