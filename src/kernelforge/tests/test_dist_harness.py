"""The guarantees a multi-rank driver gets by not writing them.

The harness exists so that a list of properties stops being requirements a
driver author is asked to remember. These tests hold it to the two that are
enforced by construction rather than by checking -- inputs that differ across
ranks and across the two parity calls, and both candidate calls issued before
either is compared -- plus the refusals that keep a run from being reported at
all.

The cross-rank collectives are replaced with a single-process stand-in so the
capture, timing and comparison paths run for real on the GPU that is present.
What that leaves untested is the part that needs more than one device: the
device binding, and any behaviour of a real NCCL/RCCL collective.
