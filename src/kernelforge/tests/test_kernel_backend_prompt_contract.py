# ---------- snapshot hashes -------------------------------------------------

# The fixture mocks ``build_forge_knowledge`` to a constant sentinel, so these
# hashes cover the prompt TEMPLATE only. A change to which knowledge folders a
# backend is served (``resolve_language_dirs``) leaves every hash here alone --
# which makes an unexpected diff in this table a precise signal that prompt text
# moved, not that knowledge assembly did.
# Every hash below has been re-snapshotted three times: once in the KernelForge
# -> Hyperloom merge (which rewrote one runnable command in a shared knowledge
# card -- the old package name in ``python3 -m <pkg>.mcp_server.tools.bench``),
# once for the backend-vocabulary rename, which reaches the prompt TEXT because
# each backend introduces itself by name ("You are the CK kernel backend --"),
# and once for the local_knowledge card renames (cheap_sweeps.md ->
# lever_cheap_sweeps.md and friends). That last one moved every hash even
# though only ck/hip/triton prompts.py changed, because the two cards every
# backend is pointed at live in the shared prompt_utils.py preamble.
# The intellikit backend's removal moved only aiter's hash: its prompt listed
# `languages/asm/` in the language-folder routing, and that folder went with the
# backend (diffed: one line changed, nothing else).
# The token-efficiency pass moved aiter/ck/hip/triton and nothing else. Two
# edits, both diffed line by line against the previous rendering: the four
# prompts stopped naming `build`/`test`/`bench`/`pmc`/`registers` as tools --
# this loop has Bash and the driver, those tools do not exist, and the framing
# paragraph in orchestrator/agent.py used to spend a sentence per session
# translating the names back into shell -- and triton's Gluon-escalation section
# deferred its mechanics to the two cards it already routes to, keeping the
# trigger, the ownership claim and the route resident (see
# test_gluon_backend.py::TestTritonEscalationHint, which pins exactly those).
# Each time the rendered prompts were diffed line by line against their previous
# rendering; for the card renames every changed line was a card name and nothing
# else moved. See test_rename_completeness.py for the tree-wide check.
# The acceptance-gate correction moved all nine, the only re-snapshot so far
# that had to: the loop stopped running the task's declared suite for every
# backend but assembly, and each prompt still described the removed step.
# Diffed line by line. The eight non-assembly prompts swapped the nine-line
# task-config paragraph for the seven-line driver one; assembly kept its
# paragraph less the warm-start clause, which no path performs any more; the
# five agent-facing sentences that repeated the claim outside the shared
# paragraph were corrected (aiter/ck/hip/triton step 4, flydsl step 4, ck's
# iron rule, fusion's stop condition, gluon's smaller-shape trap); "GATE" as a
# name for the performance target became "performance target" in ck/hip/
# hipblaslt, since the word now has a defined meaning beside it; and hipblaslt
# gained the paragraph it had never rendered despite three stop conditions
# resting on it.
# Keeping sweep knobs out of the deliverable moved the eight source backends and
# left assembly byte-identical, which is the expected shape: the two edits are
# both in the shared prompt_utils.py preamble, and assembly renders neither
# card. Diffed line by line against main: the changed content is one identical
# block in all eight (same md5 over the diff bodies). The edit-surface bullet
# gained the converse it had always implied but never said (reaching someone
# else's environment constant is in scope, authoring a new read in the
# deliverable is not), and the sweep bullet replaced "KEEP the knobs ... strip
# at submission" with a collapse to the selected literals before the
# implementer ends its turn.
# The null-fused-timing rule moved fusion's hash alone: the harness contract now
# says a fused time may be omitted only alongside "skipped": true, and that the
# driver anchors the pristine run on the eager time instead of failing it.
# Diffed line by line -- six added lines and one rewrapped, nothing else moved.
# The launch-count gate moved fusion alone, in four places of the one rendering
# (diffed line by line, nothing else changed): rule 3 gained the NET-count
# requirement, the harness contract gained a counting step plus the two
# `*_launches` JSON fields and the rule that gates on them, the baseline-run note
# says the gate is exempt there, and the ATTEMPT template reports both counts.
# The contract text reaches this prompt through prompt_utils, so a future edit to
# harness_contract.py will move this hash without fusion/prompts.py changing.
# The eager-arm provenance gate moved fusion alone again, all of it inside the
# harness contract (diffed line by line): steps 1-3 now require the eager arm to be
# traced from the real forward pass, proved against the recorded kernels with the
# profiler, and the fused arm to be one call to the authored entry point; the JSON
# object gained `eager_kernels`/`eager_matches_trace` and the rule that reads them;
# the remaining steps are the same text renumbered 6-8.
