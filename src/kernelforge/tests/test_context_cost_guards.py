"""Guards on the two things that make a Forge session's context expensive.

Measured over 316 end-to-end Forge runs, ~72% of the LLM bill is proportional
to how large each agent session's context grows (cache write + cache read),
and the median session writes ~133k tokens of it. These pin the two places
this repo can act on that: what it inlines into every prompt, and whether a
missing output filter stays visible.
