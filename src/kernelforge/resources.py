"""Runtime access to packaged KernelForge resources and writable state roots.

KernelForge ships inside the Hyperloom distribution, so its knowledge base,
examples and serving patches always live at ``kernelforge/data`` next to the
code -- there is no "repository root" to fall back to. Everything under that
tree is read-only: it may sit in a root-owned ``site-packages`` and is replaced
wholesale on upgrade. Mutable state therefore goes to a separately resolved
writable root, never back into the package.
