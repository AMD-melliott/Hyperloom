"""Decide when a repository must be edited where it is, and serialize who does.

An editable install answers ``import`` from a ``sys.meta_path`` finder pinned to
one directory, so a lane that copies the repository and edits the copy measures
the original: its change is never loaded and the campaign reads as no
improvement. Such a repository has to be edited in place, which makes it shared
mutable state between every lane that reaches it -- hence one lock, taken by
whoever is about to write, keyed on the repository itself so it holds across
processes.

Both halves live here rather than beside one lane because a second opinion on
either is a defect. Two answers to "is this editable" would have one lane copy
while another edits in place; two lock implementations, or two lock paths, would
serialize nothing at all.
