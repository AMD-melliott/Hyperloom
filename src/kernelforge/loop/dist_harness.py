"""The measurement harness a multi-rank driver runs inside.

A collective is only measured honestly when a list of properties all hold at
once: the ranks really launched, each owns its own device, inputs differ per
rank, the timed region carries no synchronization, parity is judged over two
back-to-back calls, the reported time is the slowest rank's, and the process
group is torn down. Left to a driver author, each one is a separate chance to
produce a plausible number that describes something other than the collective.

So the driver does not own them. This module owns the run -- torchrun bootstrap,
device binding, process-group lifetime, per-rank seeding, warmup, graph capture,
barrier placement, the cross-rank reduction and the stdout contract -- and the
driver supplies only what is specific to its operator: how to build inputs, how
to call the candidate, and what the answer should be. The properties above stop
being requirements a driver is asked to remember and become code it does not
write.

Two of them are worth naming because they are enforced by construction rather
than by checking. Inputs cannot be identical across ranks or across the two
parity calls, because this module reseeds between them rather than trusting
``build_inputs`` to vary. And no barrier can land inside the timed region,
because the driver never sees the timed region at all.

Copied next to the driver during task preparation, imported as ``dist_harness``.
