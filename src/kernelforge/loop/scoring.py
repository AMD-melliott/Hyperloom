SNR >= {DEFAULT_SNR_THRESHOLD_DB:g} dB is a fast pre-filter, NOT the gate. A KEEP is decided by the
task's own `compile_command` and then its `correctness_command`, both from its
`config.yaml`, which forge runs on every candidate it would otherwise accept,
and whose tolerances are the task's, not forge's. Run both yourself before you
propose a change: a candidate that clears SNR and fails either is reverted, and
the error it raised is the only thing that tells you what to fix. The
`compile_command` may build a different, smaller shape than the one you measure,
so a guard you add for the shape you tested can still reject it there."""

# The gate for a backend whose candidate is judged by the driver alone. Saying only what decides, because an agent
# told how acceptance is mechanized optimizes against the mechanism.
_DRIVER_GATE_PROMPT = f"""\
A KEEP needs two things and nothing else: the driver's own correctness suite must
clear the SNR gate ({DEFAULT_SNR_THRESHOLD_DB:g} dB unless the campaign set another), and the mean
measured speedup must beat the incumbent by more than this candidate's own
measurement spread. Verify through the driver before you propose a change.
Whoever consumes the result may apply checks forge does not run -- an evaluator
that builds a smaller shape than the one you measure, for instance -- so
clearing this gate is not the same as being accepted downstream."""
