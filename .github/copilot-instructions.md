# Copilot code-review instructions (Hyperloom)

Advisory review. Flag only what static gates can't.

## What to review for

- **Correctness / semantic edge cases**: null/empty/boundary inputs, off-by-one,
  unhandled `None`, silent truncation, a branch that returns the wrong default.
- **Duplication / parallel routes**: a second implementation of something that already
  exists. Point to the existing one and ask to extend it.
- **Size and complexity**: a unit past a trigger in the style guide's
  [Size and complexity](../docs/contributing/style-guide.md#size-and-complexity), which
  owns the numbers and the exceptions. No linter covers this (Ruff runs `E`/`F`/`W`;
  Pylint is `--errors-only`), so review is the only place it surfaces. Name the seam to
  split on, not just the line count, and don't ask for cleanup of an already oversized
  function merely because the change edits it — but do flag a newly crossed threshold, or
  branches and responsibilities added to a unit already over.
- **Cohesion and coupling**: a module that has acquired a second job, a responsibility
  moved to the wrong layer, a dependency pointing back up the layers, a new import cycle,
  or a caller reaching around the layer that owns a thing. A diff that bypasses an
  established pipeline or reintroduces a retired construct belongs here too — the
  architecture doc named in `AGENTS.md` is the authority on where a boundary lives.
- **Failure-hiding error handling**: a `try`/fallback that swallows an error and returns
  a default or `None`, so the caller can't tell success from silent failure. This includes
  a new broad `except Exception` that hides the failure rather than catching a specific,
  expected error — neither ruff's `E`/`F`/`W` nor `pylint --errors-only` flags it.
- **Concurrency**: missing/incorrect `await`, races on shared state, unawaited tasks,
  blocking calls on the event loop.
- **Unused abstraction**: a flag, strategy, or generic helper added for a single caller,
  or a parameter always passed the same value.
- **Contract & cache invariants**: a change that silently alters an external contract
  or breaks a documented rule.
- **Test strategy**: exported behaviour — a CLI flag, public function, persisted schema,
  artifact layout — landing without a test that pins the contract and its failure modes.
  The inverse too: per-function unit tests bolted onto internal plumbing that only threads
  a flow together, where a test at the entry point is what the change actually needs. A
  replaced test that drops a contract or failure-mode assertion, or moves it behind an
  `*_e2e` marker CI excludes, belongs here as well.
- **PR focus**: the PR addresses one aspect. If it bundles unrelated changes, say so.
- **Fix-around instead of fix-upstream**: a local workaround for what is really a
  GEAK/Magpie/TraceLens/framework defect.
- **Debt growth**: a new feature flag / env toggle used to route around a design
  problem, a new suppression without a stated reason, or dead code left in place —
  unreachable statements after a `return`/`raise`, commented-out blocks, `# removed …`
  tombstones. Pylint's `W0101` is warning-category, so CI's `--errors-only` invocation
  never reports it.
- **Unstated observable effect**: an observable change — a behaviour, interface, default,
  flag, or artifact — whose PR description neither says what an operator will now see nor
  says why the change is unobservable.

## What NOT to flag

- Bare `except:`, formatting, import order, naming, line length → ruff.
- Unused variables and unused imports → ruff (`F841`/`F401`). (Cyclomatic complexity is
  *not* covered by ruff or by `pylint --errors-only` — review it under **Size and
  complexity** above.)
- Known-vuln patterns, injection, secrets → CodeQL / gitleaks / bandit.

## How to comment

- **Frame structurally.** Say what shape the code should have and why rather than flagging
 an isolated line. The best comment makes the implementation efficient.
- **Argue from cost and clarity.** Justify each note by what it buys: less duplication,
  one source of truth, etc.
- **Be specific not tedious.** Anchor to a line or the existing code being duplicated,
  but skip style/taste nits a linter would catch.
- **Prefer deletion and reuse.** When you see a leaner form — reuse an existing helper,
  drop a redundant layer, fold a flag away — propose it directly. A replacement that
  leaves the old path reachable, or keeps a wrapper or a second format only to preserve an
  internal shape, is unfinished: ask which consumer still needs it.
