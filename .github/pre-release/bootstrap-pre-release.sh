# Pre-release E2E pod bootstrap. Runs as the SaFE Authoring workload entrypoint. It
# reproduces the manual release path: install the packaged wheel, write a pod-local
# .env, install a pinned Claude CLI, then drive setup + demo skills through
# `claude --print`. The poll job (outside the pod) judges the session afterwards.
# See hyperloom-pre-release-e2e-ci-design.md §12.
#
# Two modes, selected by E2E_DOCKER_HOST:
#   * unset  -> a single baremetal leg in THIS pod (LEG_ID given).
#   * "1"     -> the privileged 8-GPU host: run each of DOCKER_LEGS as a backgrounded
#                run_leg (docker mode) ON THE HOST POD. Each leg's agent follows the
#                demo skill to `docker run` its OWN single-GPU container (renderD =
#                128 + gpu_index*8), so the skill owns the container lifecycle. The
#                per-leg GPU-isolation values are computed here and injected via .env.
#
# Inputs (env, injected by the dispatch script):
#   CI_VERSION NFS_ROOT
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_B64          base64 key; decoded into the leg's .env, which lives on
#                                  NFS with the workspace the agent reads it from. Kept off
#                                  stdout and out of the API payload, but NOT off NFS: the
#                                  EXIT trap scrubs the key, so a SIGKILL leaves it on disk.
