# Run a Hyperloom optimization

This topic assumes you have already completed installation. If you haven't, follow the [Hyperloom installation instructions](../install/install.md) then return here to launch your first run.

## Launch from Claude Code or Codex

Open the Hyperloom workspace in Claude Code or Codex, then paste the following
prompt into the agent chat, filling in your workload details:

```{note}
The prompt includes `install.sh`. This is intentional: the agent runs in its own
shell process, which does not inherit the environment you sourced during
installation. The agent must re-source the env files and re-run `install.sh` in
its own context before launching the optimizer. Because `install.sh` is
idempotent, the second run is fast and safe.
```

```{note}
Paths in the prompts on this page follow the recommended `pip install --target .`
layout. In a source checkout, replace the `hyperloom/` prefix with
`src/hyperloom/`.
```

```text
@hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md

Optimize inference for this workload:
- Model: /path/to/your/model
- Framework: sglang
- GPU: MI300X
- TP: 1
- CONC: 64
- ISL: 1024
- OSL: 1024
- Goal: improve throughput by at least 10%
- Budget: 24 hours

Before launch, run exactly:
export REPO_ROOT="$(pwd -P)"
export USER_DATA_PATH='/path/to/hyperloom-run'
bash "$REPO_ROOT/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh"
# The optimizer preflight loads the generated runtime environment in process.

Requirements:
1. Report the session ID, log path, PID, and initial health check result.
2. Read persisted state on requested status checks; report completion or failure. Do not start a watchdog or automatic resume loop.
```

| Field | Meaning | How to choose |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `TP` | Tensor-parallel size — number of GPUs the model is sharded across | Must match the number of GPUs in your server node (for example, `8` for a single 8-GPU MI300X node) |
| `CONC` | Concurrent requests — baseline benchmark concurrency (`--conc`, default `64`) | Set to your target concurrency. The SWEEP phase separately measures a ladder around it: `256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2` for a synthetic workload, `1,4,8,10,14,20,28` under `HYPERLOOM_AGENTX`, where it runs only with `--enable-conc-sweep`. Override the ladder with `--conc-sweep-concs`. |
| `ISL` | Input sequence length — tokens in each request's prompt | Match your production workload; `1024` is a common starting point |
| `OSL` | Output sequence length — tokens generated per response | Match your production workload; `1024` is a common starting point |

```{note}
`ISL` / `OSL` describe the synthetic request shape. Under the opt-in agentic
trace-replay mode (`HYPERLOOM_AGENTX=1`) request lengths come from the recorded
trace corpus instead, so these two values do not affect what is measured — the
server's context window is sized from the model's own configuration rather than
from `ISL+OSL`.
```

See [`src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Hyperloom/blob/main/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md)
for the full prompt field reference (every field maps to a CLI flag defined in
`cli/parser.py`).

## Monitor the run

The agent reports a session ID, log path, and PID, then reads persisted state
on requested status checks. Recurring checks may use the hosting platform's
scheduled invocations; no background supervisor or automatic restart is started.
Logs are useful evidence, but activity alone does not prove useful progress.
Under the hood the optimizer walks the phase chain
`PRELUDE → ENABLEMENT → FRAMEWORK_AGENT → KERNEL_AGENT → SWEEP → CLOSE`; see
[Hyperloom optimization loop](../conceptual/optimization-loop.md) for each phase
and [benchmark deadlines](../reference/environment-variables.md#benchmark-deadlines-and-lifecycle)
for the independent benchmark and session limits.

## Resume an interrupted session

Paste this prompt into the agent chat to resume an existing session:

```text
@hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md

Resume the existing Hyperloom optimization session.

Requirements:
1. Launch `python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize --resume-from "$SESSION_DIR"`; do not start a new session.
2. Do not pass `--model`; read the model and workload from the saved manifest.
3. Resolve `$SESSION_DIR` from the launch-info JSON or the `HYPERLOOM_LAUNCH` line, never from the newest timestamp dir.
4. Before launching, verify `manifest.json` and `state.json` exist.
5. Report the log path, PID, health check, current phase, cumulative gain, and best config.
6. Read persisted state on requested status checks; report completion or failure. Do not start a watchdog or automatic resume loop.
```

## Output and artifacts

When the loop exits, Hyperloom writes the final report, reproducible session
artifacts, and `session_breakdown.json` to your session directory. The three
fields to read first are:

| Field | What it tells you |
|-------|-------------------|
| `final.throughput_tok_s_per_gpu` | Validated end-of-session serving throughput — the headline number for SGLang / vLLM |
| `final.cumulative_gain_pct_validated` | Validated gain over baseline |
| `final.action_path` | Ordered list of changes that make up the final optimized stack |

For the full schema — useful if you are building a dashboard, reporting
pipeline, or downstream integration on top of this file — see
[`session_breakdown.json` integration in Hyperloom](../reference/session-breakdown.md).

## Troubleshooting

If a run fails on first launch, see [Troubleshooting Hyperloom](../reference/troubleshooting.md).
