.. note::

   TraceLens does not have hard requirements for the GPU, ROCm version, or the OS; it has scripts to verify whether a trace is valid/parseable. TraceLens is:

   - OS-independent and runs anywhere Python does.
   - Not limited to MI300X/MI325X/MI355X; it's hardware-agnostic.

   See the `TraceLens documentation <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/tracelens/en/latest/reference/compatibility.html>`_ for more information.

.. note::

   MI325X shares the gfx942/CDNA3 runner family with MI300X. Hyperloom keeps the
   resolved GPU types distinct, but Magpie benchmark rendering reuses the MI300X
   runner scripts and image family unless a dedicated image is supplied.

Inference frameworks
--------------------

The following inference frameworks are supported:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 15 65

   * - Framework
     - ROCm version
     - Notes
   * - SGLang
     - 10.0 (docker) / 7.2.4 (bare-metal wheel)
     - Default framework. Validated ``docker`` images use ROCm 10.0 (``rocm10`` tags below). On a ROCm 7.2.x bare-metal host the installer still derives ``SGLANG_ROCM_EXTRA=rocm724`` from ``torch.version.hip`` (see below).
   * - vLLM
     - 10.0 (docker, bare-metal source) / 7.2.3 (bare-metal wheel)
     - Validated ``docker`` image is the ROCm 10.0 build below. On bare metal the
       installer routes by the detected stack: a ROCm 7.2.x host installs the
       ``rocm723`` wheel, a ROCm 10 host (``torch.version.hip`` 7.15) builds vLLM
       from source, and any other combination is rejected (see below). Do not mix
       frameworks within one session
   * - ATOM
     - 7.2.4 (recorded image stack)
     - AMD out-of-tree engine, launched as ``python3 -m atom.entrypoints.openai_server``. Supports Docker, direct execution in a preinstalled ATOM/ROCm torch environment, or a bare-metal source install with ``--install-framework atom``. The recorded image-based stack used ``rocm/atom-dev:v0.1.7-rc0`` on MI355X, not a universal ATOM pip-version minimum. Other builds require local validation. An unset or empty ``KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER`` resolves to GEAK here as it does for every framework, and explicit values are preserved.
   * - ``custom``
     - Host-defined
     - Escape hatch for your own benchmark script; Hyperloom does not manage the server lifecycle. Requires ``HYPERLOOM_BENCHMARK_BACKEND=bypass`` plus ``--framework-path`` (or ``FRAMEWORK_REPO_PATH``) and ``--benchmark-scripts-dir`` (or ``HYPERLOOM_BYPASS_SCRIPTS_DIR``); the CLI exits with status 2 when any of the three is missing.

Container images
----------------

Pick the image that matches your environment. Public Docker Hub refs are used
on your own GPU machine: the official upstream ``lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:<tag>``
for SGLang, ``rocm/vllm:<tag>`` for vLLM and
``rocm/atom-dev:<tag>`` for Atom. If your deployment uses a private registry
mirror, set the registry prefix accordingly.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 70 30

   * - Image
     - GPU
   * - ``lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.20-rocm10-mi30x-20260920``
     - MI300X / MI325X
   * - ``lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.20-rocm10-mi35x-20260920``
     - MI355X
   * - ``rocm/vllm:rocm10.0.0_ubuntu24.04_py3.14_pytorch_2.12.0_vllm_0.27.0``
     - MI300X / MI325X / MI355X
   * - ``rocm/atom-dev:v0.1.7-rc0``
     - MI355X (verified); MI300X / MI325X untested

The images default to ``/bin/bash``, which exits at once in a detached
container, so override the entrypoint (for example ``--entrypoint tail``) when
starting a long-running Hyperloom container.

The ``rocm/vllm`` image serves an installed wheel, so ``install.sh`` turns its
``/app/vllm`` checkout into the patchable source tree: it pins the tree to vLLM
commit ``f46a9dfe2c5f`` (``VLLM_IMAGE_SOURCE_COMMIT``) under a synthetic baseline
commit and puts it ahead of site-packages on the server's ``PYTHONPATH``. This
activates only when the installed wheel's version names that commit; any other
vLLM image is left on its wheel.

``rocm/atom-dev`` also publishes a ``latest`` tag, which tracks the newest
nightly build and moves. Pin the versioned tag so a session stays reproducible.

`hub.docker.com/r/lmsysorg/sglang-rocm/tags <https://hub.docker.com/r/lmsysorg/sglang-rocm/tags>`_,

Bare-metal recommended environment
-----------------------------------

For ``baremetal`` setup, align the host to this combination before running setup.
Hyperloom does not install ROCm or torch itself.

For ATOM, ``baremetal`` means running directly in the development machine's
selected Python environment, including when the development platform itself is
a container; it does not start an additional Docker container. ATOM is either
already installed there or installed by setup with ``--install-framework atom``,
which builds AITER and then ATOM (default ``ATOM_REF``: the commit
``rocm/atom-dev:v0.1.7-rc0`` was built from) against the existing ROCm torch in
that Python. That Python must not also serve SGLang or vLLM: ATOM registers
plugins that both engines load by default, so setup refuses to install ATOM
where either imports (including a ROCm 10 vLLM venv built over that Python),
and refuses to install SGLang, shared vLLM or ROCm 10 source vLLM where ATOM
imports. Run ATOM in a separate container instead. Verify a real ``import atom`` and a non-empty ``torch.version.hip``
with that Python, keep its executable first on ``PATH`` for Magpie's ``python3``
launch, and use ``PYTHON`` with ``INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_FORCE_PYTHON=1`` if pinning
the interpreter. Keep any activated venv consistent; ``/opt/venv`` is not required.

Run ``python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.setup --check-only --
--install-framework none --frameworks atom --require-frameworks`` with the
selected interpreter first. Only after approval, repeat without ``--check-only``:
``none`` skips framework installation but can still write configuration and
apply ROCm hotfixes. Preserve the selected ``USER_DATA_PATH``; an existing setup
need not be repeated. Hyperloom does not assert a minimum ATOM package version
derived from a Docker tag. Import checks establish local prerequisites, not
end-to-end validation of every stack.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 25 60

   * - Item
     - Recommended
     - Notes
   * - Operating System
     - Ubuntu 24.04
     - Recommended bare-metal baseline. vLLM 0.28.0+ ROCm wheels require glibc >= 2.39, so Ubuntu 22.04 hosts must downgrade vLLM (for example ``VLLM_VERSION=0.27.1``) or use ``docker`` mode instead.
   * - ROCm
     - 7.2.x or 10.0 (bare metal) / 10.0 (docker)
     - Patch levels differ by framework and setup mode. On ROCm 7.2.x, vLLM installs the ROCm 7.2.3 wheel (``rocm723``); on ROCm 10.0, vLLM is built from source. On a ROCm 7.2.x bare-metal host, SGLang resolves ``SGLANG_ROCM_EXTRA=rocm724`` (ROCm 7.2.4 layer). The validated ``docker`` stacks use ROCm 10.0 user space (``rocm10`` images above), not the 7.2.x bare-metal wheel paths.
   * - Python
     - 3.12
     - Required by the vLLM ROCm wheel. The vLLM source build accepts Python >= 3.10, < 3.15.
   * - ROCm torch
     - ROCm build matching the host ROCm
     - Preinstalled by the operator; not managed by Hyperloom.
   * - SGLang
     - 0.5.20 (rocm10), pinned to commit ``94602c9c2b7c``
     - Recommended ``docker`` stack uses the ``lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.20-rocm10-*`` images above (ROCm 10.0 user space). ``SGLANG_REF`` is the ``v0.5.20`` release commit (peeled from the tag object). The pin sits at 0.5.20 because through 0.5.18 the HIP extra pinned ``compressed-tensors==0.15.0``, which caps torch below 2.11 and therefore cannot resolve at all against a ROCm 10 stack; 0.5.19 moved that dependency into ``runtime_common`` unpinned, leaving the installer's ROCm torch constraint as the version pip solves for. Bare-metal installs on ROCm 10 take the source-install path; on ROCm 7.2.x hosts, ``SGLANG_ROCM_EXTRA=rocm724`` still selects the AMD wheel index. Kernel-shape profiling for SGLang >= 0.5.18 uses TraceLens ``kernel_shape_tool`` rather than git-applying SGLang roofline patches.
   * - vLLM
     - v0.29.0 (rocm723) wheel on ROCm 7.2.x; v0.29.0 source build, pinned to commit ``98dff2a81d74``, on ROCm 10; isolated venv
     - On ROCm 7.2.x, installs ``vllm==0.29.0+rocm723`` from the wheels.vllm.ai pip index on Ubuntu 24.04+. vLLM's ROCm wheel pins its own torch, so it installs into a dedicated venv (``--framework-env isolated``, the default for vLLM) and never touches the host torch. On ROCm 10 (``torch.version.hip`` 7.15) no wheel is published, so the installer checks out ``VLLM_SOURCE_REF`` (the ``v0.29.0`` release commit) into ``VLLM_ROOT`` (default ``/opt/hyperloom/vllm``) and builds it into ``VLLM_VENV_ROOT`` as a system-site-packages venv over the host ROCm torch. The source route requires ``--framework-env isolated``, ``git``, ``gcc``/``g++`` >= 11.3, ``cmake`` >= 3.26.1, ``ninja``, ``hipcc`` and the ROCm devel headers, installs AITER into the same venv when it is not already importable, and writes ``VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER=1`` to ``.env`` when ``aiter`` imports. ``VLLM_INSTALL_METHOD`` (``auto``, ``wheel``, ``source``) can only confirm the detected route; a ROCm stack other than 7.2.x or 10 is rejected.

Bare-metal ROCm patch levels differ per framework. On ROCm 7.2.x the vLLM stack
installs the ``rocm723`` variant (ROCm 7.2.3); on ROCm 10 it builds from source
against the host ROCm, matching the ROCm 10 user space of the ``rocm/vllm`` image
the ``docker`` route uses; the SGLang stack
installs from the ROCm 7.2.4 AMD wheel index when a host stays on ROCm 7.2.x;
the recommended SGLang ``docker`` stack uses the two
``lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.20-rocm10-*`` images (ROCm 10.0). ``docker`` mode is still
the preferred route for a pre-validated stack, since the images also pin the
surrounding torch, Triton, and AITER builds.

These are recommended defaults, not hard pins. Framework and ROCm versions are
overridable via env (``SGLANG_REF``, ``SGLANG_ROCM_EXTRA``, ``VLLM_VERSION``,
``VLLM_ROCM_VARIANT``, ``VLLM_INSTALL_METHOD``, ``VLLM_REPO``, ``VLLM_SOURCE_REF``,
``VLLM_ROOT``) for hosts that need a different pinned stack.

The table above is the validated combination. ROCm 7.2.x is validated under a
single ``/opt/rocm`` prefix. ROCm 10.0 arrives as TheRock's pip wheels, split
across the ``_rocm_sdk_*`` namespace packages, which is the layout the ``rocm10``
images are built from and the one the ROCm 10 routes are validated on: the
bare-metal installer probes those packages for library resolution and, before a
framework source build, supplies the devel headers and toolchain root from them.
Only ROCm 7.0.x and 7.2.x have a published ``amd-sglang`` wheel; any other stack
falls back to a source install. See :doc:`/install/install`.
