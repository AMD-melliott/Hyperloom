# Hyperloom coding style guide

This document describes the conventions contributors should follow when changing
[Hyperloom](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Hyperloom). It complements
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) (authoring rules), [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
(workflow and checks), and the machine-readable settings in `pyproject.toml`.

When this guide and tooling disagree, **tooling wins** — update the guide if you change
`pyproject.toml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, or CI workflows.

## Principles

1. **Correctness before cleverness** — prefer readable code with tests over micro-optimizations.
2. **Automate what you can** — run `pre-commit` locally; let CI enforce the rest.
3. **No secrets in the tree** — credentials belong in environment variables or secret stores.
4. **License hygiene** — every file must satisfy [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) (see below).
5. **Shape is reviewable** — maintainability, readability, extensibility, and reliability are review criteria, not afterthoughts; see [Size and complexity](#size-and-complexity).

## Python

### Language and layout

| Setting | Value | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Minimum Python | 3.10 | `requires-python` in `pyproject.toml` |
| Target version | 3.10 (`py310`) | `[tool.ruff] target-version` |
| Line length | 120 | `[tool.ruff] line-length` |
| Package layout | `src/hyperloom/...` | setuptools `where = ["src"]` |

### Formatting and lint (Ruff)

Ruff is the single formatter and linter for Python.

- **Format:** `ruff format .` (Black-compatible; 120 columns).
- **Lint:** `ruff check .` — rules `E`, `F`, `W` (pycodestyle errors, Pyflakes, warnings).
- **Ignored globally:** `E501` (line length — owned by the formatter), `E741` (single-letter names in math/parsing helpers).

Run both before opening a PR that touches Python:

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .   # or `ruff format .` to apply
```

**Do not** add `# noqa` or per-file ignores unless there is a documented reason (import cycles, test patterns). Existing per-file ignores live in `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]` — extend that table instead of inline suppressions.

**Future rules** (`B`, `I`, `UP`, `SIM`, `RUF`) are commented in `pyproject.toml` and will be enabled once the backlog is zero. New code should already follow import sorting and common bugbear patterns even before those rules are turned on.

### Size and complexity

Nothing enforces these today: Ruff selects `E`/`F`/`W` only (no `C901`), and CI's Pylint is `--errors-only`, which excludes `R0912`/`R0915`. They are **review triggers for new and rewritten code** — the point at which a reviewer asks for a split or for the reason the shape is right.

| Unit | Trigger | Where the number comes from |
|------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Function length | ~60 lines | Just above the tree's 90th percentile |
| Cyclomatic complexity | 10 | McCabe default; measurable on demand with `ruff check --select C901` |
| Module length | ~800 lines | Roughly the tree's 90th percentile |

Neither number identifies a problem on its own. A long function can be one prompt template with a complexity of 1, and a short one can carry a dozen field comparisons that still need semantic review. Crossing a trigger asks the reviewer to look for a responsibility boundary, not to assume there is one — and "this is a single template" is an accepted answer. Split when it improves ownership, data flow, or testability.

**How the lines are counted:** a function spans its `def` line through its last line, decorators excluded and blank, comment and docstring lines included; a nested or `async` function is measured on its own, not folded into its parent. Module length is physical lines. The triggers cover the Python whose style we own — `src/hyperloom` and `src/kernelforge`, minus Ruff's `extend-exclude` in `pyproject.toml`, which already names the vendored SDK copies and the shipped `src/kernelforge/data` examples. Tests are exempt from the size triggers — a table-driven test that gains a case per behaviour is doing its job — though the command below still reports them. They are not exempt from the duplication and boundary rules.

Measure rather than argue:

```bash
ruff check --select C901 --config "lint.mccabe.max-complexity=10" src/hyperloom src/kernelforge
```

Passing a trigger is not a merge blocker — it means the PR description says why, or the change splits. The tree carries a backlog above all three: **do not grow it**, and prefer leaving a file you touched smaller than you found it. Editing a unit that was already over the trigger is not a demand to repay its debt; adding branches or a second responsibility to it is. Extracting a helper while you are in there is in scope; a standalone rewrite of an unrelated module is a separate PR (see [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) § *One concern per change*).

Structure the split along the boundaries the code already has — one job per module, cohesive inside, dependencies pointing one way down the layers. A split that only moves lines to a second file, leaving the two halves reaching into each other, trades one long file for a cycle.

### Module structure

Follow patterns in existing packages (for example, `hyperloom.orchestrator`):

```python
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

"""One-line module summary."""

from __future__ import annotations

import stdlib...
import third_party...
from hyperloom... import local...
```

- **`from __future__ import annotations`** — use in new modules for forward references and cleaner hints.
- **Module docstring** — required for public modules under `src/hyperloom/`.
- **Imports** — stdlib, then third party, then `hyperloom.*`, separated by blank lines. Some modules intentionally import after constants (see per-file `E402` ignores); do not reorder those without understanding the cycle.
- **Constants** — `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` at module level; prefix private constants with `_`.
- **Types** — use modern syntax (`str | None`, `list[str]`, `collections.abc` for parameters). Prefer typed public APIs; `Any` only at boundaries (JSON, subprocess, LLM payloads).

### Type checking (mypy)

mypy is **recommended locally**, not yet a CI gate:

```bash
pip install mypy
mypy src/hyperloom
```

Guidelines:

- Add type hints to new public functions and dataclass fields.
- Use `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks for import-only types.
- Do not silence mypy with broad `# type: ignore` — narrow the ignore or fix the type.

When mypy is promoted to CI, configuration will live in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.mypy]`.

### Security (Bandit)

Bandit scans production code (`src/hyperloom`, `scripts/`). Tests are excluded.

- `B101` (assert) is skipped repo-wide — asserts are allowed in tests and invariants.
- Fix medium-and-higher findings before merge; do not add new `nosec` comments without a security review comment in the PR.

### Pylint

CI runs `pylint --errors-only` on core packages (fatal/error severity only). Fix new error-level issues in touched modules; convention, refactor, and style messages are intentionally out of scope — including `R0912`/`R0915`, which is why the thresholds in [Size and complexity](#size-and-complexity) are carried by review rather than by a gate.

### Tests (pytest)

| Convention | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Location | `**/tests/` next to the code under test; operator scripts use `scripts/tests/` |
| Discovery | `[tool.pytest.ini_options] testpaths` in `pyproject.toml` |
| Async | `asyncio_mode = auto` |
| Markers | Register new markers in `pyproject.toml`; use `@pytest.mark.<name>` |

**E2E markers** (skipped in CI by default):

- `critic_agent_e2e`, `targeted_build_e2e`

**What to test:** Pin the **exported surface** — CLI flags, public functions, persisted schemas, artifact layouts — with tests that state the contract *and* its failure modes; those are what callers outside this repo depend on. Pick the boundary by what is being protected: a focused unit test for deterministic logic, or a CLI/filesystem/serialization integration test where that pins the contract more directly. Internal functions that only thread a business flow together do not each need one: per-function tests there assert the current implementation and break on the next refactor. Prefer covering those flows through their entry point, and unit-test an internal helper when it carries real logic of its own.

**When you replace a test,** carry its contract and failure-mode assertions across, and keep them in the default CI selection — the `*_e2e` markers above are excluded from it, so they supplement that baseline rather than stand in for it. The 90% line-coverage floor cannot show that a specific assertion survived.

**Coverage:** CI enforces **90% line coverage** on measured trees (`[tool.coverage.report] fail_under`). CLI drivers, subprocess wrappers, and hardware-only paths are omitted from the denominator — see `[tool.coverage.run] omit`. Cover the logic you introduce as described under *What to test*; do not chase coverage on omitted paths, and do not pad internal plumbing with per-function tests to move the number.

**Naming:** `test_<behavior>.py`, functions `test_<scenario>`, classes `Test<Component>`.

## Shell scripts

Shell scripts live under `scripts/`, `src/hyperloom/**/assets/`, and agent tool directories.

- Target **bash** unless the shebang says otherwise.
- **Quote variable expansions** — most ShellCheck findings are `SC2086` (unquoted `$var`).
- Use `set -euo pipefail` in new scripts when safe (existing scripts may omit it for compatibility — match neighbors).
- Run **ShellCheck** locally: pre-commit includes `shellcheck-py`.

## YAML and GitHub Actions

- Workflow files must include REUSE SPDX headers (see below).
- **yamllint** uses the `relaxed` preset; line-length is disabled to avoid churn.
- **actionlint** validates `.github/workflows/` — pin action versions (`@v7`), avoid `${{ }}` injection pitfalls.

When adding a workflow that should skip on documentation-only changes, copy the **canonical `paths-ignore` list** from `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Markdown and documentation

- User-facing docs: `docs/` (Sphinx / Read the Docs).
- Agent skills and operator references may live beside code (`SKILL.md`, `references/`).
- Use MyST/Sphinx conventions for new `docs/` pages; CI builds with `sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html`.
- Link to ROCm docs where appropriate: [Hyperloom on ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hyperloom/en/latest/index.html).

## Licensing (REUSE)

Every committed file must have clear copyright and license metadata:

1. **Preferred:** SPDX header at the top of the file:

   ```text
   # SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
   # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   ```

   Use `#` for Python/shell/YAML, `<!-- -->` for Markdown/HTML as appropriate.

2. **Fallback:** aggregate annotation in `REUSE.toml` for file types that cannot carry headers (some binary/config patterns).

Run locally:

```bash
pip install reuse
reuse lint
```

CI enforces this through the **REUSE Compliance** workflow.

## Commit and pull request hygiene

- Branch from `main`; keep commits logically grouped.
- PR description: problem, approach, test evidence.
- **Do not commit:** virtualenvs, `.coverage`, build artifacts, large logs, credentials, local `.env`.
- **Observable effect:** required. Anything an operator can observe is described in the PR that changes it, and the release cut aggregates those into the GitHub release — see [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) § *Authoring rules of engagement* for what counts and what is exempt.

## Local development checklist

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # or Windows equivalent
pip install -e ".[test,ci]"
pip install pre-commit ruff mypy reuse
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files   # first-time baseline

pytest -m "not critic_agent_e2e and not targeted_build_e2e"
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
mypy src/hyperloom
reuse lint
```
