# Hyperloom operator scripts

A short reference for the operator-facing scripts under
`src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/tools/`. These are not part of the agent loop —
they are utilities you run by hand against a finished or in-progress
session directory.

When no explicit `--session-dir` is given, scripts resolve the active session in
two steps: `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_CURRENT_SESSION_DIR` when set, otherwise the
workspace root (`USER_DATA_PATH`, falling back to `/workspace/hyperloom`). This
does **not** auto-discover the latest `$USER_DATA_PATH/<model>/<ts>/` per-session
subdir — under the per-model timestamp layout, pass `--session-dir` explicitly
(or rely on `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_CURRENT_SESSION_DIR`, which the CLI sets during
a run). See [Hyperloom authentication and credentials](authentication.md).

---

## `status.py`

Print the current phase, wall-clock budget, lane and GPU occupancy, task
counts, and recent lifecycle events for a session. Read-only, so it is safe to
run against a live optimization.

Also available as a subcommand: `python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli status`.

Use this when:

* You want to know what step a running optimization is on without reading the
  log firehose.
* You need a machine-readable progress snapshot for a dashboard or a wrapper
  script (`--json`).
* You are checking whether a session is still alive after a suspected crash.

Unlike the other scripts on this page, `status.py` auto-discovers the newest
`$USER_DATA_PATH/<model>/<timestamp>/` session when no `--session-dir` is
given, instead of stopping at the workspace root.

### Usage

```bash
# Active session (auto-discovered)
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.status

# A specific session
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.status --session-dir <SD>

# Machine-readable snapshot
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.status --session-dir <SD> --json

# Live view, refreshed every 2s (Ctrl-C to exit)
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.status --watch
```

### Reading the output

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `running` / `STALLED?` / `ended` / `liveness unknown` | Whether the owning optimizer process is still alive. `ended` means the session recorded a `stop_reason`. `STALLED?` means the process is up but `state.json` has not been rewritten recently — often a long benchmark, sometimes a wedged Coordinator. |
| `last update ... ago` | Age of the newest evidence. Shown whenever the observation is not live, so a stale snapshot is never presented as current. |
| `ELAPSED` | Cumulative time in that phase across **all** macro cycles, not just the current entry. Phases repeat: SWEEP loops back to EXPLORE. |
| `BUDGET` / `USED` | Shown for the running phase only. The budget is charge-back — a phase receives its share of the time *still remaining*, so an overrunning earlier phase shrinks every later one. `USED` above 100% is a real overrun and is reported, not clamped. |
| `gain ... validated` | Gain re-measured on a fresh server. A provisional per-round figure is shown alongside only when the two disagree. |
| `—` | Not measured. Never a substitute for a real zero. |

Exit codes: `0` when the session was read (whatever state it is in), `3` when
no session directory could be resolved, `130` on Ctrl-C. As with `examine`-style
commands, the exit code reports whether the command **ran**, not what it found —
so a script can distinguish "could not look" from "looked, and the run is over".

## `dump_session_breakdown.py`

Produce a `session_breakdown.json` from a session directory. Same
builder as the live Coordinator `session_breakdown` action and the
`cli.py` finally-block safety net.

Use this when:

* You want to (re)produce the breakdown for a historical session on a shared
  filesystem.
* A live session crashed before reaching the closing phase and you
  want the partial breakdown anyway.
* You need to bulk-export breakdowns for downstream indexing.

### Usage

Use these commands to produce a session breakdown.

```bash
# Live session in the current sandbox (USER_DATA_PATH or /workspace/hyperloom)
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown

# Historical session on a shared filesystem
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown \
    --session-dir /shared/hyperloom-sessions/<user>/<sid>

# Override output path (don't touch session_dir)
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown \
    --session-dir <SD> --output /tmp/breakdown-<sid>.json

# Bulk historical
for d in /shared/hyperloom-sessions/*/*; do
    [ -d "$d" ] || continue
    python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_breakdown \
        --session-dir "$d" > /dev/null
done
```

The default output path is `<session_dir>/session_breakdown.json`
(overwrites if present; the file is rebuilt deterministically from raw
artifacts).

### Output

`session_breakdown.json` conforming to
[`session_breakdown.json` integration in Hyperloom](session-breakdown.md).
The script exits 0 on success, prints a one-line summary, and writes
collector warnings to the `warnings[]` field rather than failing.

---

## `dump_session_report.py`

Render a markdown session report from a `session_breakdown.json`.
Deterministic by default; optionally large language model (LLM)-polished when an
OpenAI-compatible endpoint is configured.

Use this when:

* You want a human-readable summary to paste into a PR, Slack, or
  email.
* You want to generate the same report for many sessions in bulk.

### Usage

Use the following commands to render a session report.

```bash
# Deterministic only (no LLM):
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_report \
    --input  /shared/hyperloom-sessions/<user>/<sid>/session_breakdown.json \
    --output /shared/hyperloom-sessions/<user>/<sid>/session_report.md

# With LLM-polished prose (OpenAI-compatible endpoint):
HYPERLOOM_REPORT_LLM_BACKEND=openai \
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint/v1 \
OPENAI_API_KEY=... \
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.dump_session_report \
    --input  /shared/hyperloom-sessions/<user>/<sid>/session_breakdown.json \
    --output /shared/hyperloom-sessions/<user>/<sid>/session_report.md
```

When `--output` is omitted the report is written to
`<session_dir>/session_report.md` next to the input file. The LLM
user prompt and raw response (when used) are persisted alongside as
`session_report_prompt.json` / `session_report_llm_raw.txt` so
hallucinations can be audited after the fact.

### LLM hardening

The script applies the following safeguards when LLM polishing is enabled.

* The deterministic skeleton (headline numbers, action_path,
  kernel_lifecycle counts) is generated *without* the LLM; the LLM
  only rewrites prose.
* If the LLM call fails (timeout, 5xx, malformed response), the
  script falls back to the deterministic report and exits 0.
* If you do not want any LLM call, leave
  `HYPERLOOM_REPORT_LLM_BACKEND` unset.

---

## `event_counts.py`

Print recent action / proposal / kernel counts from a session's
`coordinator.db`.

Use this when:

* You want a quick "is this session making progress?" check without
  reading logs.
* You are debugging an apparent stall and want to see what kind of
  events are landing.

### Usage

Use the following commands to print event counts for a session.

```bash
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.event_counts            # default session_dir
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.event_counts /path/to/session
```

Reads at most the last 500 events from
`$SESSION_DIR/storage/coordinator.db` and emits a JSON object of
`{category: count}`. Exit code 2 if the database (DB) is missing.

### Example output

The script emits a JSON object of event categories and counts.

```json
{
  "delegated:kernel_optimization:succeeded": 7,
  "delegated:tracelens_analysis:succeeded": 1,
  "kernel_request:kernel_optimization": 7,
  "kernel_request:tracelens_analysis": 1,
  "kernel_response:kernel_optimization:KEEP": 3,
  "kernel_response:kernel_optimization:NEEDS_REVIEW": 4,
  "proposal:explore": 12,
  "proposal:specialist": 4,
  "proposal:kernel_opt": 5
}
```

A long run with healthy progress has roughly proportional
`proposal:*` and `delegated:*:succeeded` counts. A stuck run typically
shows many `kernel_request:*` and few `kernel_response:*`.

## Additional operator tools

The same tools package also contains smaller utilities that are useful during
incident response or launch validation:

* `backfill_langfuse.py`: replay one finished session's `reports/trace/` into
  Langfuse after the fact:
  `python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.tools.backfill_langfuse --session-dir <SD> [--dry-run]`.
* `preflight_optimizer.py`: launcher-side local preflight for stale serving
  processes, torch/ROCm device visibility, GPU VRAM occupancy (exits non-zero
  when any card exceeds 1% of its total capacity), and model path existence:
  `python src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/tools/preflight_optimizer.py MODEL_PATH`.
  A non-zero exit must abort the launch.
* `read_optimizer_state.py`: concise `state.json` / lifecycle summary:
  `python src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/tools/read_optimizer_state.py SESSION_DIR`.
* `robustness_monitor.sh.example`: shell example for polling robustness
  findings around a session; copy/adapt it for local operator workflows.
