# GEAK

GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-Centric Kernels) is a multi-agent framework for end-to-end GPU kernel
optimization in real codebases. It runs a closed loop of profiling, optimization, and
validation, and produces reviewable patches backed by reproducible benchmarks.
GEAK supports Triton, HIP (and CUDA, Composable Kernel (CK), and HSA Code Object (HSACO)), and FlyDSL
kernels. It is driven by [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) and ships two
deterministic JS Workflows — `e2e_workflow` for whole-model serving throughput and `kernel_workflow`
for single kernels — with a deterministic control plane (budget loop, parallel fan-out, verification,
stop conditions) that invokes LLM agents only for judgment.

Within Hyperloom, GEAK is the whole-pipeline end-to-end optimization delegate: when a workload is
handed off, the orchestrator invokes GEAK once at the kernel-agent phase through the stable
`interface/run_e2e.py` contract (a `handoff.json` in, a `result.json` back). Parallel exploration of
candidate kernels then happens inside GEAK's Workflows on the on-box GPUs.

## Role in Hyperloom

Hyperloom uses GEAK as the **whole-pipeline e2e delegate** when
`KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER=geak` (the bare-metal default). In this mode the
orchestrator hands the optimization workload to
`src/hyperloom/agents/kernel/tools/backends/geak_runner.py`, which resolves the
GEAK checkout and launches GEAK's e2e runner (`interface/run_e2e.py`) with the
generated session context.

When GEAK owns the phase it runs the whole optimization loop itself — both the
end-to-end serving optimization *and* the per-kernel work underneath it, since
GEAK's `e2e_workflow` recursively drives `kernel_workflow` to author and tune the
individual hot kernels worth fixing. See
[Hyperloom optimization loop](../conceptual/optimization-loop.md).

## Current-best launch configuration

The handoff's `baseline_env_spec.config` carries the accepted server arguments,
environment assignments, `remove_args`, `unset_envs`, and `args_mode`. An explicit
`args_mode: replace` preserves a complete argument list even when it is empty.
Without an observed `server_launch_flags` snapshot, this mode prevents recipe
arguments from being restored. A nonempty snapshot from the same promoted
measurement remains the complete launch base, including script-derived defaults.

Environment removals precede the accepted assignments, so a later explicit
assignment can re-add a variable. The launch identity includes removal and
replacement controls: changing them invalidates the same-configuration throughput
reference. Handoffs with default append mode and no removals retain their existing
identities.

## GPU pinning in the handoff

GEAK launches full servers out-of-process (baseline, profile, config-tuning
validation) and writes a visible-devices mask for each one, so the handoff has
to say which cards the run owns. Two fields carry that, in two different
coordinate systems:

| Field | Coordinate system | Value |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| `gpu_ids` | HIP-level device list — HIP indexes into the ROCr-visible set | logical positions inside an in-force ROCr-level mask (process env **or** baseline recipe), capped at `tp` and at the mask width (`ROCR=6` → `"0"`); a HIP-level mask nested inside that slice is already logical and is forwarded instead (`ROCR=4,5,6,7` + `HIP=2,3` → `"2,3"`, i.e. cards 6 and 7); any other mask passes through uncapped (`HIP=4,5` → `"4,5"`); `0..tp-1` when the run is unpinned. Never empty — a falsy `gpu_ids` sends GEAK back to its own `0..tp-1` fallback |
| `gpu_ids_space` | — | `"logical"` when `gpu_ids` indexes into a ROCr mask that is in force for the launched servers, `"absolute"` when they are whole-machine ids, `"none"` when the mask is set but empty. The one field that makes the coordinate systems distinguishable from the payload alone |
| `gpu_pin` | absolute device ids | `{"var", "value", "ids", "count", "source"}` for the winning mask, plus `"inner"` (the same shape) when a HIP-level mask is nested inside a ROCr-level one. Omitted entirely only when no mask is set anywhere, which means "whole machine visible", not "pinned to card 0"; a mask that is *set but empty* is reported with `count: 0` (zero devices visible). `value` is the mask as authored, only whitespace-trimmed and (for a YAML sequence) comma-joined, so a UUID mask can be re-exported as-is; `ids` are its numeric ids and `count` how many devices it exposes — both derived from the same effective token list, with duplicate and negative ordinals dropped, so `count >= len(ids)` always and they differ only for a (partly) non-numeric mask |

The mask is resolved variable-major, over the full ROCm precedence chain in
`common/visible_devices.py`: the ROCr-level masks (`ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, then
its legacy spelling `HSA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`) before the HIP-level ones
(`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `GPU_DEVICE_ORDINAL`). Within
each variable the process environment comes before the materialized baseline
recipe's `benchmark.envs`.

That module is also the single definition of the tuple and the mask parser that
`orchestrator/bus/gpu_pool.py`, `orchestrator/policy/gate.py`,
`actions/executors/_ray_serving.py` and `common/env_safety.py` use. Those layers
read the narrower `COUNTING_VISIBLE_DEVICE_VARS` on purpose — they answer "how
many GPUs does this process have", and widening that would change GPU accounting
repo-wide — while this resolver answers "where is this run pinned", and a run
pinned with a legacy spelling is really pinned.

The process env comes first because the recipe's ROCR key is not evidence of a
pin: `materialize_config_with_envs` autofills `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0..tp-1`
into every materialized recipe when the mask is absent or narrower than `TP`.
A recipe ROCR value byte-identical to that default is therefore ignored, so a
`HIP`-pinned or genuinely unpinned run is not silently re-pinned to cards
`0..tp-1`. A recipe mask that differs from the default *is* honoured, and its ids are
forwarded **logical**, exactly like a process-env one: GEAK starts its servers
from `launch_recipe`, which carries that mask, so the servers see a renumbered
set even though the GEAK process itself never does.

`tp` in the handoff is read from the same resolved recipe as `gpu_ids`, so the
two cannot disagree when the materializer clamps `TP` to the visible GPU count.

A consumer that re-exports `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and leaves ROCr alone should
use `gpu_ids`; that is correct in both coordinate systems, because whatever
ROCr mask is in force for the servers is left untouched.

A consumer that writes `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` itself must use
`gpu_pin["value"]` — writing `gpu_ids` there resets the child to physical card
0 whenever `gpu_ids_space` is `"logical"` — and may then use `gpu_ids` as the
inner HIP mask, because for every ROCr-level pin `gpu_ids` is already expressed
in that renumbered space. The one thing it must not do is apply an `"absolute"`
`gpu_ids` on top of a ROCr mask it also wrote (`ROCR=4,5` plus `HIP=4,5`
indexes positions 4 and 5 of a two-element set). `gpu_ids_space` is how a
consumer tells the cases apart without inferring it from `source`.

`gpu_ids_space: "none"` is the third case: the mask is set but empty, so the run
has no visible devices and no id list can be truthful. `gpu_ids` still carries
`0..tp-1` — a falsy `gpu_ids` is read as "unset" and falls back to exactly those
ids anyway (`interface/run_e2e.py`), so an empty string would buy nothing and
lose the ability to say why. A consumer must treat those ids as placeholders and
not launch on them; the orchestrator also logs the condition at ERROR, because a
GEAK run that dies on an invalid device ordinal is otherwise unexplainable.
